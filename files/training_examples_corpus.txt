The multifunctional C terminus of the hematopoietic AML1 transcription factor interacts with coregulatory proteins supports the convergence and integration of physiological signals, and contains the nuclear matrix targeting signal, the protein motif that is necessary and sufficient to target AML1 to subnuclear sites.

To determine the functional domains of Runx1 important for thymocyte development, we cultured Runx1-deficient murine fetal liver (FL) cells on OP9-Delta-like 1 murine stromal cells, which express Delta-like 1 and support thymocyte development in vitro, and introduced Runx1 or C-terminal-deletion mutants of Runx1 into the FL cells by retrovirus infection.

These observations clearly demonstrate that Runx1 functions early in hematopoietic development, and they support the interpretation that the primitive erythroid lineage is established early by a subset of BL-CFCs that develop in a Runx1-independent fashion.

Interestingly, one patient without + 21 showed amplification of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 q supporting the contention that AML1 amplification may be an important additional genetic event.

The oncogenic fusion protein AML1-ETO retains the ability of AML1 to interact with the enhancer core DNA sequences, but blocks AML1-dependent transcription.

While normal Runx1fl/fl lymphoid cells permit mono-allelic deletion, primary Eµ-Myc lymphomas showed selection for retention of both alleles and attempts to enforce deletion in vivo led to compensatory expansion of p53null blasts retaining Runx1.

RUNX1-4A, carrying four mutations at S276, S293, T300, and S303, showed impaired T-cell differentiation activity, but retained the ability to rescue the defective early hematopoiesis of Runx1-deficient cells.

We previously reported that the AML1 molecules with trans-activation subdomains retained can rescue in vitro hematopoietic defects of AML1-deficient mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells when expressed by using a knock-in approach.

In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1.

The N-terminal portion of AML1, which is retained in AML1/ETO, contains a region of homology to the FAST proteins, which cooperate with Smads to regulate transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) target genes.

When TEL/AML1 and AML1 proteins are present in cells at the same time, the TEL/AML1 protein inhibits the transactivation activities of AML1 protein on the human CR1 promoter even though TEL/AML1 retains the transactivation domain of AML1.

Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-κB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-κB luciferase activity.

Here we show that endogenous Runx1 and Foxp3 physically interact in normal mammary cells and this interaction blocks Runx1 transcriptional activity.

Mechanistically, RUNX1 interacts with the RUNX1 binding DNA sequence located in SOS1 promoter and positively regulates it.

RUNX1-IT1 contributed to the progression of PC by interacting with the adjacent gene RUNX1.

Since AML1 is a well-defined DNA-binding protein, AML1-ETO fusion proteins have been recognized as DNA-binding proteins interacting with the same consensus DNA-binding site as AML1.

The results demonstrated that Runx1 and HIF-1alpha proteins directly interacted with each other to a degree, in which Runt homology domain of Runx1 was mainly involved.

Leukemia-related abnormal Runx1 fusion protein AML1-ETO, which fuses the N-terminal 177 amino acid residues of the Runx1 protein in frame to ETO (eight-twenty-one) protein, also interacted with HIF-1alpha protein with greater ability than Runx1 itself.

Here, we demonstrate that AML1/Evi-1 interacts with CtBP in SKH1 cells, a leukemic cell line which endogenously overexpresses AML1/Evi-1 and that AML1/Evi-1 requires the interaction with CtBP to repress AML1-induced transactivation.

MEF (for myeloid ELF-1-like factor) is a recently cloned ETS family member that, like AML1B, can strongly transactivate several of these promoters, which led us to examine whether MEF functionally or physically interacts with AML1 proteins.

These findings highlight the role of EZH1 in non-histone lysine methylation, indicating that cooperation between AML1-ETO and EZH1 and AML1-ETO site-specific lysine methylation promote AML1-ETO transcriptional repression in leukemia.

RUNX1-ETO is thought to promote leukemia development through the aberrant regulation of RUNX1 (AML1) target genes.

Thus, an NGF/TrkA-MAPK-CBFβ pathway converges with Islet1-Runx1 signaling to promote Runx1/CBFβ holocomplex formation and nonpeptidergic nociceptor maturation.

RNF38-induced RUNX1 ubiquitination did not promote RUNX1 degradation, but rather stabilized RUNX1 protein.

The hormonally regulated expression of RUNX1 and RUNX2 in granulosa cells, their involvement in progesterone production, and promoted granulosa cell proliferation suggest important roles of RUNX1 and RUNX2 in follicular development and luteinization.

Since we found that high expression of RUNX1 is correlated with poor survival in patients with OC through bioinformatic analysis of TCGA database, we developed RUNX1-knockout clones by CRISPR/Cas9 technique and discovered that RUNX1 depletion could promote cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OC cells, which was further confirmed by RUNX1 knockdown and overexpression.

Collectively, we revealed that Runx1 signals chondrocyte to osteoblast lineage commitment and promotes endochondral bone formation through enhancing both chondrogenesis and osteogenesis genes expressions, indicating Runx1 may be a therapeutic target to enhance endochondral bone formation and prevent osteoporosis fractures.

Although full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia.

Isoform AML1/ETO9a was correlated to AML/M2, and it may promote the development of leukemia in combination with the AML1/ETO fusion gene.

In vitro, AML1b promoted differentiation while AML1a promoted proliferation of progenitors capable of short-term lymphomyeloid engraftment.

AML1-ETO is an oncoprotein that can promote self-renewal of primary hematopoietic cells by opposing the activity of AML1.

Most prominently we identified the commonly mutated IKZF1 and RUNX1 involved in the formation of ETV6-AML1 fusion protein, among the interaction partners.

Collectively, our study shows that AML1 gene overexpression characterizes a broader range of leukemic subtypes than previously thought, including various maturation stages of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and cytogenetic types additional to those involving the AML1 gene.

Mechanistically, a delicate RUNX1/A-E balance involving competition for common genomic sites that regulate RUNX1/A-E targets sustains the malignant cell phenotype.

Although Runx1 has been shown to be involved in BMP4 signaling in non-neural tissues, the Runx1 function in BMP4-dependent regulation of neuronal development is unclear.

Taken together, our results demonstrate that MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 regulate each other, and we propose that a double negative loop involving MIR181A1 and ETV6/RUNX1 may contribute to ETV6/RUNX1-driven arrest of differentiation in pre-B ALL.

To facilitate crystallization, a Runx1 residue involved in a hydrophobic patch that was predicted to be engaged in crystal packing based on the previously reported structures of Runx1-containing crystals was mutated.

We also provide evidence that the regulation of RUNX1 by p38α probably involves the kinase MSK1, which phosphorylates histone H3 at the RUNX1 promoter.

The Runx1 DNA contact map identifies connections with multiple novel and known haematopoietic enhancers that are likely to be involved in regulating Runx1 expression in haematopoietic progenitor cells.

The Runx1-persistent group is involved in transmitting mechanical and thermal information, whereas the Runx1-transient group transmits pruriceptive information.

Furthermore, RUNX1-IT1 enhanced the transcription of the RUNX1 gene, indicating its potential as a cis-regulatory RNA involved in the upstream regulation of RUNX1.

In summary, we propose that high levels of Runx1 in resting CD4+ T cells functions negatively in the regulation of IL-2 transcription, and that TCR activation-mediated down-regulation of Runx1 involves negative auto-regulation of the distal Runx1 promoter and contributes to IL-2 production.

Interphase and metaphase fluorescent in situ hybridization have revealed a RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion signal on derivative chromosome 8 but not on chromosome 21, confirming the unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 8 q22 and 21 q22 involving both the RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 genes.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an AML1-ETO translocation dual probe, showed that the 21 q22 breakpoint involved AML1 locus.

The transcription factor RUNX1 (AML-1, PEBP2alphaB and CBFA2) is essential for definitive haematopoiesis, and chromosomal translocations involving the RUNX1 gene are frequently found in acute leukaemias.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization performed using the probes TEL/AML1 and immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) showed no fusion involving the TEL and AML1 genes and only a single IGH signal in 20 % of the interphase cells analyzed.

Numerous studies have shown that AML1 plays a vital role in the regulation of expression of many genes involved in hematopoietic cell development, and the impairment of AML1 function disregulates the pathways leading to cellular proliferation and differentiation.

One key mechanism for over-expression seems to be the extra copies of AML1, but other mechanisms may involve an alteration of the activity of the AML1 promoter.

A search for RUNX1 sequences that may be involved in the high frequency of chromosomal translocations revealed that a 555 bp long segment originating in chromosome 11 FLI1 gene was transposed into RUNX1 intron 4.1.

In the remaining mutated cases, with acquired trisomy 21, a missense mutation of AML1, which involved 2 of the 3 copies of the AML1 gene, was found.

AML1 mutations, in MoAML involved both alleles and probably lead to nonfunctional AML1 protein.

AML1 plays a critical role during hematopoiesis and chromosomal translocations involving AML1 are commonly associated with different forms of leukemia, including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Three of eight cases found to be rearranged by Southern hybridization but lacking the characteristic phenotype failed to show evidence of the TEL-AML1 rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that at least some of the discordant cases may involve partner genes other than AML1 in the TEL rearrangement.

Southern blot analysis of bone marrow cells did not detect rearrangement of the AML1 gene, however, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of bone marrow cells at interphase and metaphase revealed a translocational splitting between chromosome 21 involving AML1 gene and chromosome 16.

In previous studies, we have shown that the intracellular expression of peptides containing the NHR2 domain inhibits RUNX1/ETO oligomerization, thereby preventing cell proliferation and inducing differentiation of RUNX1/ETO transformed cells.

The expression level of RUNX1-RUNX1T1 in bone marrow of 200 patients with newly diagnosed AML (non-M3) was detected by real-time fluorescent Q-PCR, the expression level of lymphoid antigens was detected by flow cytometry, and the relationship of the initially induced remission rate (CR1) with the overall survival (OS) rate was analyzed, the CR1 and OS differences also were analyzed between CD56+ and CD56- patients as well as CD19+ and CD17- patients in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 positive patients with AML.

Although the three RUNX1 isoforms a, b, and c were induced in CD45+ hematopoietic cells, RUNX1c was the only isoform induced in hematoendothelial progenitors (HEPs)/hemogenic endothelium.

This long-term androgen-induced loss of Ezh2 actions ultimately results in sustained reduction of the H3K27me3-repressive mark in the promoter region of the Runt-related transcription factor-1 (Runx1) gene, a luteinizing hormone (LH)-induced transcription factor essential for ovulation, leading to increased Runx1 mRNA expression.

Permethrin also induced ETV6-RUNX1 and IGH-BCL2 fusions in K562 cells, and malathion induced KMT2A-AFF1 and ETV6-RUNX1 fusions.

Furthermore, RUNX1 could be induced by LRG1 in a concentration-dependent manner, while the knockdown of RUNX1 blocked the promotion of the proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis induced by LRG1.

Mechanistically, our study showed that Hoxaas3 regulated lung fibroblast activation and fibrogenesis by acting as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-450b-5p: Hoxaas3 decreased the expression of miR-450b-5p to stimulate level and activity of Runx1 and induced fibrotic LF, whereas Runx1 inhibition alleviated the pro-fibrotic effect of Hoxaas3.

Knockdown or inhibition of RUNX1 induced more apoptosis of AML expressing mtRUNX1 versus wild-type RUNX1 and improved survival of mice engrafted with mtRUNX1-expressing AML.

Consistent with these data, disruption of endogenous RUNX1b around Met-1 using CRISPR/Cas9 induced selective expression of RUNX1ΔΝ24 in several leukemia cell lines.

AML1b-expressing cells form macroscopic colonies in soft agar and induce tumors in nude mice, indicating that AML1 can be a transforming gene when overexpressed in fibroblasts.

However, it is not clear whether or not abnormal expression of Runx1 will induce leukemia and how the change of Runx1 expression level could affect BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis.

Further, we show that AML1-MTG16 can induce epigenetic repressive changes at the histone and DNA level of the AML1 target gene Csf1r (c-fms), encoding the macrophage colony stimulating factor receptor.

An autocrine mechanism involving granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and G-CSF receptor (G-CSF-R) might participate in AML1-ETO mediated JNK-signaling, because AML1-ETO induces G-CSF and G-CSF-R expression, and G-CSF-R-neutralizing antibodies reduce AML1-ETO-induced JNK phosphorylation.

His fusion gene Aml1/Eto remained positive, so he was administered with DLI combined with interferon-a (IFN-a).

The intact SOX-LZ could form homodimers through the leucine zipper, which resulted in inhibition of DNA binding by the HMG box, while SOX-LZ (D105-356), which was incapable of dimerization, showed specific binding with the AACAAT sequence.

Thus, the repressed transactivation of the intact SOX-LZ in CHO cells was primarily attributable to the low level of DNA binding of SOX-LZ homodimers.

The transcription factor Runx1 is required for EHT, but for how long and which endothelial cells are competent to respond to Runx1 are not known.

We further show that while early embryonic Runx1 activity is required for the formation of NPPB+ cells, at later stages Runx1 switches to a genetic repressor and thus its downregulation becomes a prerequisite for the proper development of these pruriceptors.

For instance, although it has been reported that Runx1 is required for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic cell transition (EHT) but not thereafter, recent studies clearly demonstrated that Runx1 is also needed during the period subsequent to EHT, namely at perinatal stage.

The past two decades of research have taught us three important lessons: 1) patients with FPD/AML display atypical symptoms and they have a widened clinical spectrum of FPD, such as eczema and syndromic thrombocytopenia, 2) the elucidation of variant of uncertain significance (VUS) of RUNX1 have revealed their role in epigenetic functions and involvement in the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway, and 3) non-coding mutations of RUNX1 also causes FPD/AML.

Recently, there have been important advances in defining the role of CBFβ-SMMHC and its binding partners, the transcription factor RUNX1 and the histone deacetylase HDAC8.

The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain), expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16) (p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML.

Here, we report the development of a protein-protein interaction inhibitor, AI-10-49, that selectively binds to CBFβ-SMMHC and disrupts its binding to RUNX1.

First, depletion of CD8+ T cells from OT1 mice led to the induction of significant hydrosalpinx by Chlamydia, indicating that CD8+ T cells are necessary to inhibit chlamydial pathogenicity.

Thus, our data suggest an E8(I)-and Runx3/CBFβ-dependent epigenetic programming of the Cd8a locus during T-cell activation leading to Runx/CBFβ complex-independent maintenance of CD8α expression in effector T cells.

Deletion of specific Cd8 enhancers leads to variegated expression of CD8alphabeta heterodimers in double-positive thymocytes.

Despite having better overall survival, animals lacking functional CD8+ T-cells had delayed removal of necrotic tissue leading to poor scar formation and increased cardiac rupture, suggesting that CD8+ T-cells play a dual role in the cardiac remodeling process.

We have also found, however, that while some variant peptides are effective at eliciting both primary and recall CD8+ T cell responses that can recognize the parental epitope, other variant epitopes lead to the outgrowth of CD8+ T cells that only recognize the variant.

Additionally, our data reveal that CD81 inhibits Rac/STAT-1 activation leading to a negative regulation of the production of TNF-α and NO by inflammatory DCs and the activation of cytotoxic T cells by splenic CD8α(+) DCs.

We found that the lack of FcRγ on NK cells limits their ability to restrain virus-specific CD8+ T cells and that the lack of FcRγ in Fcer1g-/- mice leads to enhanced CD8+ T-cell responses and rapid control of the chronic docile strain of the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV).

PLX51107 delayed melanoma tumor growth and increased activated, proliferating, and functional CD8+ T cells in tumors leading to CD8+ T-cell-mediated tumor growth delay.

Antigen associated with lysed cells is cross-presented by CD8α+ dendritic cells leading to activation of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells.

Treatment of MCMV-infected mice with MHC-Class I-saporin tetramers led to partial (80-90 %) depletion of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells-rapidly followed by a rebound leading to expansion and maintenance of up to 40 % of total CD8(+) T cells, with minimal changes in response to a control epitope (M45).

If a TEL happens to code for a protein that contains a CD8 T cell epitope, protein processing can lead to the presentation of the antigenic peptide and restimulation of cognate CD8 T cells during latency.

These data suggest that HAART quickly starts to restore CD8(+) T-cell responses to other chronic viral infections and leads to a slow decrease in HIV-specific CD8(+) T-cell response in HIV-infected patients.

Because T-cell receptor engagement of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the absence of costimulation mediated via CD28 binding to CD80 (B7-1) or CD86 (B7-2) can lead to anergy or apoptosis, we determined whether HIV type 1 (HIV-1) virions incorporated MHC class I (MHC-I), MHC-II, CD80, or CD86.

These results indicate that the greater potential breadth of CD8 T cell responses present in heterozygous animals does not necessarily lead to greater antiviral efficacy and suggest that SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses in heterozygous animals have a skewed focus toward epitopes restricted by a single haplotype.

Collectively, our findings show that RUNX1 is required for mammary stem cells to exit a bipotent state, and provide a new method for discovering cell-state regulators when markers are not available.

There was a new suggestive association with a low-frequency variant at zinc-finger protein 154 in the AS without AAU versus control analysis (zinc-finger protein 154 (ZNF154), P=2.

Although IL-22 displayed a negligible effect on glial cells in vitro, IL-22-/- mice mounted more vigorous ZIKV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which led to a more effective control of ZIKV in the brain.

Reduced tumor and spleen uptake of 89 Zr-DFO-CD8a was observed in CD8a+ depleted mice and the uptake was comparable with that of isotype control (89 Zr-DFO-IgG2b) confirming specificity.

Thus, in addition to gaining more basic information about ZIKV biology, appropriate interventions and management strategies are being sought to control ZIKV-associated diseases and its spread.

This prospective study examined the effects of the new antiepileptic drug (AED) gabapentin (GBP) compared to the standard AED carbamazepine (CBZ) and placebo (PLA) on eye movements, posture and finger force control in 12 healthy volunteers who received single doses of 600 mg GBP and 400 mg CBZ in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over, randomized trial.

We found that HLA-A molecules with poor VZV IE62 presentation capabilities were more common in a cohort of 50 individuals with a history of HZ compared to a nationwide control group, which equated to a HZ risk increase of 60 %.

IMZ/TBZ were given in the diet to provide levels of 0 %/0 % (control), 0.0015 %/0.018 % (IMZ/TBZ), 0.006 %/0.018 % and 0.024 %/0.018 % during the gestation and lactation periods.

Five groups were studied: DZ (DZ pretreatment, n\240\= 8), ischemic control (phosphate-buffered saline pretreatment, n\240\= 11), DZ\240\+ STAT3 inhibitor LY5 (DZ pretreatment\240\+ LY5, n\240\= 8), LY5 (phosphate-buffered saline pretreatment\240\+ LY5, n\240\= 8), and sham (without cross-clamping, n\240\= 5).

Ag-specific cells from the libraries of patients with T1D were reactive with ZnT8186-194, whereas those from healthy control recognized ZnT8186-194 and other Ags.

The MLL protein interacts with RUNX1 and prevents RUNX1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation.

Thus these findings have identified a novel function for Runx1 in sustaining normal epithelial morphology and preventing EMT and suggest Runx1 levels could be a prognostic indicator of tumor progression.

Previously, it was proposed that CBFβ-SMMHC acts by dominantly repressing the transcription factor RUNX1 (Runt-related protein 1), but we recently showed that CBFβ-SMMHC has activities that are independent of RUNX1 repression.

We also demonstrated that the FDA-approved HDAC inhibitor panobinostat and a MICA/B antibody acted synergistically to enhance MICA/B surface expression on tumor cells.

MG132 increased the transcription of MICB by acting at a site in the 480 ‑bp MICB upstream promoter.

In contrast, the M7 and DK1 HLA-A2 variant cell lines, which express normal HLA-A2 serological determinants, were inefficiently lysed by CTL-8 and did not act as competitive inhibitors of normal HLA-A2 target cells.

These results show that the presence of the Bw4 epitope influences recognition of HLA-B molecules by NK cells that express NKB1, and suggest that the NKB1 molecule may act as a receptor for Bw4+ HLA-B alleles.

Indeed, histidine 59 in HLA-B,27:03 leads to a series of local conformational changes that act in concert to reduce the accessibility of the nearby cysteine 67, an essential amino acid residue for the formation of HLA-B27 homodimers.

Finally, we suggest mechanisms whereby MHC-loading enhancers could act upon MHC class II molecules.

HLA-DM, a nonclassical MHCII protein acts as a peptide exchange catalyst for MHCII, editing the peptide repertoire.

Antigen-presenting cells express another nonclassical MHC-II protein, DM, which acts as a peptide editor by preferentially catalyzing the exchange of less stable MHC-II peptide complexes, and which is inhibited when bound to DO.

The Ii-Key/MHC class II epitope hybrid acts on MHC class II molecules to facilitate replacement of antigenic peptides with the epitope tethered to the Ii-Key motif.

These results support a model in which Nef relocalizes MHC-I by acting as a connector between MHC-I\s cytoplasmic tail and the PACS-1-dependent protein-sorting pathway.

In addition, we showed that a modified CBFβ-SMMHC with decreased RUNX1-binding activity accelerates leukemogenesis.

The transcription factor fusion CBFβ-SMMHC (core binding factor β and the smooth-muscle myosin heavy chain)  expressed in AML with the chromosome inversion inv(16) (p13q22), outcompetes wild-type CBFβ for binding to the transcription factor RUNX1, deregulates RUNX1 activity in hematopoiesis, and induces AML.

As a potential source of TCRs specific for this TEL-AML1 epitope, we have used mice expressing a human TCR-αβ repertoire and human MHC class I.

CBFbeta-SMMHC is expressed in 8 % of acute myeloid leukemias and inhibits AML1/RUNX1.

MiR-302b functions as a tumor suppressor in EOC by targeting RUNX1 and modulating the activity of the STAT3 signaling pathway.

Notably, RUNX1c/tdTom(+) cells represent only a limited subpopulation of the CD34(+) CD45(+) and CD34(+) CD43(+) cells with a unique genetic signature.

Most important, miR-18a and RUNX1 could reversely regulate the permeability of BTB as well as the expressions and distributions of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5.

Moreover, master regulators of the glioblastoma multiforme mesenchymal phenotype including CEBPb, ZNF238, and FOSL2 were directly regulated by RUNX1.

Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation verified that RUNX1 interacted with " TGGGGT" DNA sequence in promoter region of ZO-1, occludin and claudin-5 respectively.

Coimmunoprecipitation assays showed that ZNF652 strongly interacts with CBFA2T3 and this interaction occurs through the COOH-terminal 109 amino acids of ZNF652.

MOZ has recently been shown to interact directly with RUNX1, indicating that MOZ fusion proteins act by deregulating RUNX1 function.

Prediction of miR-181b by using the starBase, targetscan and picTar database and its combination with literature reports indicated that CARD11, ZFP36L1, RUNX1, NR4A3, ATP1B1, PUM1 and PLAG1 related with blood diseases, and up-regulated CARD11 and ZFP36L1 participated in lymphoid tumor formation by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell aging.

CONCLUSIONS DEGs and pathways identified in the present study will help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying RUNX1 mutations in AML and develop effective therapeutic strategies for RUNX1-mutation AML.

This is the first mouse model of ETV6-RUNX1 to develop BCP-ALL and provides important insight into the cooperating genetic alterations in ETV6-RUNX1 leukemia.

ETV6/RUNX1 and MLL aberration clone size in these cases was suggestive of ETV6/RUNX1 as an early primary event, originating in the embryonic or infant stage and developing into leukemia by later acquisition of MLL aberration, ETV6 loss, and ETV6/RUNX1 duplication as secondary events.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Our studies reveal a generalized control mode by Runx1 for pruriceptor development and consolidate a hierarchical control mechanism for the formation of sensory neurons transmitting distinct modalities.

There was cell-to-cell variability, with some cells expressing no CD4 and others expressing high CD4.

Circulating human CD4(+) CD25(high) CD127(-) T reg cells significantly expressed higher levels of RUNX3, FOXP3, and TGF-beta mRNA compared with CD4(+) CD25(-) cells.

The CD4 gene is regulated in a stage-specific manner during T cell development, being repressed in CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative (DN) and CD8 cells, but expressed in CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) and CD4 cells.

In this study, we investigated the cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in CD44(+) CD24(+) SW1222 colon cancer cells expressing Cdx1 (CD44(+) CD24(+) Cdx1(+) stem cells) and CD44(+) CD24(+) HCT116 colon cancer cells expressing wild-type p53 (CD44(+) CD24(+) p53wt stem cells).

Amnion and UCM-MSCs expressed embryonic and MSC markers, such as Oct-4 CD44, CD184, and CD29, whereas AF-MSCs expressed Oct-4, CD44.

The results show that all breast cancer cells overexpress CD74 isoforms, MIF, and CD44, in contrast to the normal cell lines and normal breast tissues, which express only CD44 and MIF in low levels.

To answer this question, we utilized CD44-negative human gastric carcinoma cell line MKN74 manipulated to stably express CD44 standard form (CD44s).

These CD4+ T cells may represent a relatively rare population of T cells that express a T-cell receptor capable of cross-reacting with an MHC class I/peptide complex with sufficient affinity to allow triggering in the absence of the CD4 coreceptor.

Mature bone marrow CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressed similar HLA-A and-B levels as hHSC, while in the peripheral blood they expressed significantly more HLA-B7 (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.004 for CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, respectively).

After expansion in culture, the majority of the BKV-specific CD4(+) T cells, in addition to expressing CD40L (CD154), secreted both interferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, contained both granzyme A and granzyme B, and degranulated/mobilized CD107 in response to antigen-specific stimulation.

Variants were engineered into the SIVmac239 backbone and in Nef expression plasmids and flow cytometry was used to examine surface tetherin expression in primary CD4 T cells and surface CD4 expression in SupT1 cells engineered to express rhesus CD4.

The primary outcome included absolute changes of peripheral blood CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Tregs which measured by flow cytometry and expressed as the percentage of the total population of CD4+ T lymphocytes at pre-exposure (0-h) and post-exposure (2-h and 24-h) to anesthetic gas.

By contrast, both rat primary CD4+ T cells and established T cell lines expressing human CD4, CCR5, CyclinT1, and CRM1 genes were infected inefficiently, but this was ameliorated by inhibition of cyclophilin A.

Multicolour flow cytometric analysis identified a CD4(+) CD8alphaalpha(+) CD8alphabeta(+) T-cell population in NHPs as well as in human subjects that expressed the degranulation marker CD107a and may represent a unique CD4(+) T-cell subset endowed with cytotoxic capacity.

Activated CD4(+) T cells that expressed low levels of IL-18Ralpha could produce IFN-gamma when stimulated with the combination of IL-12 and IL-18, while CD4(+) cells which expressed high levels of IL-18Ralpha could respond to IL-18 alone.

We assume a linear random effects model with subject-specific intercepts and slopes and normal errors for the true log and square root CD4 counts, and a proportional hazards model for AIDS-free survival time expressed as a function of current true CD4 value.

The re-expressed CD28 was functional and restored the ability of CD4(+) CD28(null) T cells to express CD25 and CD40 ligand.

Our studies found that IL-12 but not IL-21 could induce the differentiation of human naive CD4(+) T cells into multi-cytokine expressing CD4(+) T cells in vitro, which co-expressed IL-21 and IFN-γ with or without IL-2 and TNF-α.

The expansion of T CD4(+) IL-17A-F(+) cells, as well as of T CD4(+) cells expressing IL-23Rp19 (T CD4(+) IL-23R(+)), considered as the pathogenic phenotype of effector Th17 cells, was found to be confined to the joints of PsA patients, as the frequencies of both populations were significantly higher in SF than in matched PB, or in PB of HC.

Instead, Shp1(fl/fl) CD4-cre mice had increased frequencies of memory phenotype T cells that expressed elevated levels of CD44.

We found changes of both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in highly HIV-exposed, uninfected individuals, with a lower level of naive and CD28(+) T cells and higher levels of HLA-DR(+) T cells and CD4(+) T cells expressing CCR5 and memory CD4(+) T cells than in control subjects.

Per(-) GraA(-) GraB(-) and Per(-/low) GraA(+) GraB(-) cells were predominantly found in CCR5(-) CCR7(+) and CCR5(high/low) CCR7(-) subsets, respectively, of CD8(+) T cells expressing the CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) phenotype, whereas Per(low) GraA(+) GraB(+) cells were found in the CCR5(low) CCR7(-) subset of those expressing this phenotype and in a part of the CCR5(-/low) CCR7(-) subset of those expressing the CD27(-/low) CD28(-) CD45RA(-/+) phenotype.

Flow cytometric analyses showed that human CD8+ T cells with naïve (CD27+ CD28+ CD45RA+) or memory (CD27+ CD28+/- CD45RA+) phenotypes included a population expressing a high level of CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3high) and one expressing a low level of it (CXCR3low), but those with the effector phenotype (CD27- CD28- CD45RA+/-) included a population that did not express CXCR3 (CXCR3-) and a CXCR3low population.

CD4(+) T cells from infected stomach expressed increased levels of the homing receptor L-selectin and the chemokine receptor CCR4 compared to CD4(+) T cells from uninfected stomach.

SSp-1-specific CTLs expanded from memory T cells of both recovered SARS patients, and the five exceptional healthy donors shared a differentiated effector CTL phenotype, CD45RA(+) CCR7(-) CD62L(-), and expressed CCR5 and CD44.

In comparisons of chemokine receptor expression on naive (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) CD3+ lymphocytes, there were greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes in RA PB and RA SF, and greater percentages of memory CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes expressing CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR3 than naive CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes in RA SF, suggesting receptor up-regulation upon lymphocyte activation.

CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-lymphocyte subpopulations expressing the other chemokine and adhesion receptors (CXCR4, CD11a and CD49d) were reduced to a similar extent as compared with overall CD4(+) or CD8(+) T-lymphocyte counts.

There were significantly more BAL CD4+ T cells expressing CXCR3, CCR5, IL-12R and IL-18R compared with paired PBL CD4+ T cells.

We demonstrate here that the activated CD4dimCD8bright T cells are not undergoing apoptosis and do not produce significant intracellular levels of interferon gamma (IFNgamma), interleukin 2 (IL-2), or IL-10 but express elevated levels of intracellular IL-4 in comparison to CD8+CD4- and CD4+ T cells.

Chronically infected individuals exhibited striking depletion of GALT CD4(+) T cells expressing CXCR4, CCR5, and alpha E beta 7 integrin, but CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratios in blood and GALT were similar.

In the healthy population (n = 30) studied, 24.6 per cent of CD4 T cells expressed CCR5 and the percentage of CD4 T cells expressing CXCR4 was 80.4.

IL-12 failed to prime CD4(+) or CD8(+) healthy clones for high CCL5/regulated on activation, normal T expressed and secreted (RANTES) production, although its secretion was impaired in CD4(+) clones from IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) and IFN-gammaR1(-/-) patients.

We show differential expression of chemokine receptors among NKT cell subsets: CCR4 is mainly expressed by a high cytokine (interleukin-4/interleukin-2)-producing (CD4) NKT subset, while CCR1, CCR6, and CXCR6 are preferentially expressed by the low cytokine-producing CD8 and CD4(-) CD8(-) subsets.

We have confirmed that CD4⁺ NKT cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) predominantly express CCR5 rather than CXCR4, whereas the reverse is true for CD4⁺ T cells derived from circulating PBMCs, and that R5-tropic HIV-1 expands efficiently in the CD4⁺ NKT cells.

Sooty mangabey CD4(+) T(CM) cells that express low amounts of CCR5 showed reduced susceptibility to SIV infection both in vivo and in vitro when compared to CD4(+) T(CM) cells of rhesus macaques.

It was directly correlated to the number of helper cells, required the continuous presence of the CD4(+) T cells, dependent on host antigen-presenting cells (APCs) expressing CD40 and on the formation of CD4/CD8/APC cell clusters.

Analysis of the in vitro induction of Tc17 cells showed that these cells were induced from the CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(+) naive subset and that they expressed the CD27(-) CD28(+) CD45RA(-) and CCR6(+) phenotype.

Although memory CD4 T cells did not express normal activation markers, they displayed a significant up-regulation in the density of CD4 but not CCR5 expression between days 7 and 10 postinfection that correlated with increased plasma IL-15 levels and infection in these cells.

We found a consistent association between the frequency of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing HLA-DR and the frequency of resting CD4+ T cells containing HIV DNA.

We found higher levels of activation markers (CD38, HLADR) on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, lower percentages of naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, higher percentages of CD8+ T cells and of CD8+ T cells expressing CD25, and lower levels of CXCR4+CD4+ T cells in EU IDUs than in unexposed controls.

In addition, using an SI strain of HIV-1 which directs expression of a reporter protein on the surface of infected cells, we have found that the immature CD4+/CD8+ thymocytes that express the highest levels of both CD4 and CXCR4 are the cells that are preferentially infected and depleted by the virus in vitro.

Infection of CD3+ CD8+ CD45RA+ cells was detected in 9 of 16 study subjects at frequencies ranging from 30 to 1, 400 proviral copies/10(6) cells, more frequently than CD3+ CD8+ lymphocytes expressing the RO isoform of CD45 (n = 2, 70 and 260 copies/10 (6) cells).

In this study, we explored the therapeutic utility of adoptively transferred CD4+ T\240\cells expressing an HIV-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR4) to restore CD4+ T\240\cell function to the global HIV-specific immune response.

The activation markers such as HLA-DR and CD45RO expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were increased in severe and extremely severe patients compared with mild patients.

Interestingly, most of SARS-CoV S-specific memory CD4(+) T cells were central memory cells expressing CD45RO(+) CCR7(+) CD62L(-).

CD4(+) NKG2D(+) lamina propria lymphocytes from patients with CD highly expressed interleukin-15R alpha, and interleukin-15 increased NKG2D and DAP10 expression in CD4(+) NKG2D(+) T-cell clones.

Although CD45RA- memory PRA(100-108)-specific T cells were found in some individuals, the majority of PRA(100-108)-tetramer+ T cells expressed CD45RA, suggesting a naive phenotype.

In individuals who were HLA-A,0201, CD8(+) T cells that expressed CD45RA and were specific for the pp65 protein (NLVPMVATV epitope) had lower avidity than those that expressed CD45RO and demonstrated decreased cytokine secretion and cytolytic potential after specific activation.

We demonstrate that CD49a is expressed early following T\240\cell activation in\240\vivo, and TGF-β and IL-12 induce CD49a expression by CD8+ T\240\cells in\240\vitro.

In tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), LAG3 expression was highest on CD4+\240\regulatory T cells (Tregs) and was also highly expressed on CD8+\240\T cells compared with CD4+\240\non-Tregs (both\240\P\240\=.

Additionally, trauma plasma did not induce CD4+ T cell expansion but did cause a phenotypic shift towards CD38+/CCR7+ expressing CD4+ T cells.

Sixty-one female SLE patient were measured for CD4 and CD8 T cell-associated senescence markers, including percentage of end-stage differentiated T cells (CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing CD57+ or loss of CD28 expression), of naïve T cells (CD4+ CD45RA+ and CD8+ CD45RA+), memory T cells (CD4+ CD45RO+ and CD8+ CD45RO+), and antigen-experienced T cells (CD4+ KLRG1+ and CD8+ KLRG1+) which were measured using flow cytometry.

We have demonstrated that tonsillar CD4+ T cell can express various Th effector cytokines after short-term polyclonal stimulation, and that cytokine-producing CD4+ T cells were CD45RO+ T cells.

Immunophenotyping by flowcytometry for measurement of CD4 and CD8 T cell counts was used and the percentages of cells expressing CD4 and CD8 were estimated per lymphocyte population.

Secondary dependent variables were CD8+ and CD4+ T-cells expressing CD45RO + CD45RA- (memory phenotype), CD45RO-CD45RA+ (naïve phenotype), and the naïve phenotype to memory phenotype T-cell ratio (lower ratios associated with immunosenescence).

Vaccination induced durable systemic RSV-F-specific T-cell responses characterized mainly by CD4+ T cells expressing Th1-type cytokines, as well as RSV-F-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, IgG, and IgA in the respiratory tract.

In addition, Jak3(-/-) CD4(+) T cells express high levels of programmed death-1 and lymphocyte activation gene-3 and modestly suppress the proliferation of wild-type CD4(+) T cells in coculture assays.

Although equivalent amounts of CD45, which acts as a Jak phosphatase, was expressed on the two T cell populations, those on the CD8(+) T cells have less protein tyrosine phosphatase activity than those on the CD4(+) T cells.

Thus, the expression of specific CD45 isoforms on T cells correlates with their proliferative response to IL-2, suggesting that controlling cells expressing specific CD45 isoforms could correct excessive or insufficient immune responses.

In the absence of CCR5, the percentage of CD4+CD25+ T cells expressing Foxp3, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR (GITR), CD103, CD45low, and CTLA-4 in the granulomas was significantly decreased.

Here, we tested the distribution of CD4/CCR5-tropic [ MLV(HIV) ]-pseudotype vectors in transgenic mice expressing CD4 and either CXCR4 or CCR5 of human origin.

Nevertheless, the observation that IIIB gp120 strongly primed tailless CD4 co-down-modulation on human osteosarcoma HOS cells that express undetectable levels of surface CXCR4 raised the possibility that membrane component(s) other than those recently identified can be involved in down-modulation of the CD4/gp120 complexes.

Recombinant soluble CD4 (sCD4) activated fusion between effector cells expressing Env and target cells expressing coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) but lacking CD4.

In contrast, neither SIRC cells expressing CD4 alone nor murine 3 T3 cells expressing CCR5 and CD4 exhibited significant expression of p24.

The expression of CCR5 was largely restricted to the memory (CD45RAlow) subset, whereas CXCR4 was expressed on both memory and naive (CD45RAhigh) T cells.

In CD4 expressing CCR5 and CXCR4 double positive NIH 3 T3 cells, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis revealed that CCR5 was associated with CXCR4 and CD4.

Compared to NIH 3 T3CD4 cells expressing CXCR4, the entry of an HIV-1 X4 isolate (HCF) into NIH 3 T3CD4 expressing both CXCR4 and CCR5 was reduced.

Unlike microglia that express and utilize CD4 and chemokine coreceptors CCR5 and CCR3 for HIV-1 infection, astrocytes fail to express CD4.

Although CCL4 and CCL5 expression was higher in livers of infected WSX-1(-/-) mice than infected WT mice, and hepatic CD4⁺ T cells from WSX-1(-/-) mice expressed higher levels of CCR5 than cells from WT mice, migration of CD4⁺ T cells to the liver of WSX-1(-/-) mice during infection was not controlled by chemokine (R) signalling.

HIV-1-resistant cells expressing either CD4 or a coreceptor are often surrounding HIV-1-susceptible cells expressing both CD4 and a compatible coreceptor, in vivo.

Flow cytometric and mRNA analysis of human CD4 in vaginal tissue suggested that HSV-2 infection increased the number of T cells expressing human CD4 in vaginal tissue.

We showed that primary CD4 T cells expressing GPI-scFv X5 were resistant to CCR5 (R5)-, CXCR4 (X4)-, and dual-tropic HIV-1 and had a survival advantage compared to control cells ex vivo In a hu-PBL mouse study, GPI-scFv X5-transduced CD4 T cells were selected in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues upon HIV-1 infection.

Results reported herein show that S1P stimulation of MTB-infected monocytes (i) inhibits intracellular mycobacterial growth, (ii) enhances phagolysosome maturation and the transit of mycobacteria in MHC class II compartments, (iii) increases the frequency of MTB-specific CD4+CD69+ T cells expressing the inflammatory homing receptor CCR5, derived from tuberculosis patients and PPD+, BCG naïve, healthy subjects, and (iv) induces IFN-gamma production in CD4+CD69+CCR5+ T cells derived from PPD+ healthy individuals, only.

Since previous studies of whole allergen immunotherapy demonstrated a reduction in the frequency of allergen-specific (MHC II tetramer+) CD4+ T cells expressing the chemokine receptor CRTh2, we assessed the impact of Cat-PAD on the frequency and functional phenotype of Fel d 1-specific CD4+ T cells.

For laboratory purposes CD40-stimulation is provided by NIH/3T3 cells expressing recombinant human CD40 ligand (tCD40L NIH/3T3).

In a previous report, using purified murine LC, we showed that freshly prepared LC (fLC) do not express CD40, whereas cLC express CD40.

We examined the expression of CD40L on LC and found that both fLC and cLC expressed mRNA for CD40L.

When we examined the cytoplasmic CD40L, however, both fLC and cLC expressed cytoplasmic CD40L.

These results indicate that CD40L is expressed on cLC, and that CD40L on LC modulates the expression of costimulatory molecules such as B7-1 and B7-2 on LC.

CD40, a costimulatory receptor molecule expressed mainly on antigen presenting cells, some non-immune cells and tumors, binds to CD40 ligand molecule expressed transiently on T-cells and non-immune cells under inflammatory conditions.

By developing a bioinformatics platform to dissect antigen-specific responses, we discovered a cell population consisting of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing identical TCRs, herein termed CD4/8 T cells.

Naïve CD4+ T cells co-cultured with LP340 treated dendritic cells highly expressed cytokine receptor IL-27R and were CD49b and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 double positive.

In vitro-simulated ischemia/reperfusion showed that NGAL-deficient CD4+ T cells express higher levels of IFN-γ mRNA compared with WT CD4+ T cells.

Nrp1+Foxp3- CD4 T cells had higher proliferation potential expressed higher levels of the memory marker CD44, and produced more IFN-γ when compared with Nrp1- CD4 T cells.

Mechanistically, we found that CD4 T cells that express Nrp1 have an increased capacity to migrate to the aorta and periaortic lymph nodes compared to Nrp1- T cells, suggesting that the expression of Nrp1 facilitates the recruitment of CD4 T cells into the aorta where they can be pathogenic.

Furthermore, single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of CD4 thymocyte subsets revealed that IL-2 was expressed in self-reactive CD4SP thymocytes, which also contain T reg precursor cells.

In this study, we describe a novel, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific IFN-γ+CD4+ T cell population expressing surface markers characteristic of naive-like memory T cells (TNLM), which were induced in both human (CD45RA+CCR7+CD27+CD95-) and murine (CD62L+CD44-Sca-1+CD122-) systems in response to mycobacteria.

CD4, CD25, CCR6, IL-9, NF-κB, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, STAT6 and Foxp3 expressing GITR+ and CD45+ cells were measured in the spleen using flow cytometry to assess anti-inflammatory effects of AMG487.

Suprisingly, such naïve CD4+ CD45RBhigh T\240\cells failed to express the Il9r or respond to IL-9 in vitro, in contrast with CD4+ CD45RBlow T\240\cells.

10 mice and the α7 nAChR agonist GTS-21, investigation of (1) antigen processing-dependent and (2)-independent, antigen presenting cell (APC)-dependent, naïve CD4+ T cell differentiation, as well as (3) non-specific APC-independent, anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs-induced CD4+ T cell differentiation, revealed the differential roles of α7 nAChRs expressed on T cells and APCs in the regulation of CD4+ T cell differentiation.

CD40 was highly expressed on adipose tissue macrophages in mice, and CD40/CD40L signaling promoted the expression of antigen-presenting cell markers in adipose tissue macrophages.

Thus, in Itk-deficient mice, mature CD4(-) CD8(+) (CD8 single-positive [ SP]) thymocytes express high levels of the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) and are dependent on IL-4 being produced in the thymic environment by a poorly characterized subset of CD4(+) thymocytes expressing the transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger.

The majority of RV and Flu tetramer(+) CD4 T cells in healthy volunteers expressed markers of antigen experienced T cells, but only RV specific CD4 T cells expressed intestinal homing receptors.

This naturally occurs through interaction with CD40 ligand (CD40L) expressed on CD4+ T-helper cells.

CDX-1140 binds outside of the CD40L binding site, and addition of recombinant CD40L greatly enhances DC and B activation by CDX-1140, suggesting that CDX-1140 may act synergistically with naturally expressed CD40L.

Directly ex vivo or with TCR stimulation, LAG-3+ CD4+ T cells expressed significantly higher levels of IL-10 and TGF-β than LAG-3- CD4+ T cells.

Tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells were significantly less potent in expressing IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-17, and more potent in expressing IL-10 than circulating CD4+ T cells.

In addition, a subset of the responding CD4+ T cells expressed forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3), indicating that although a regulatory component of the vaccine-activated CD4+ T cell response was induced, the anti-tumor vaccine response was not limited by these regulatory CD4+ T cells.

Further characterization of the CD34+ CD4+ subpopulation demonstrated that these cells expressed lower levels of HLA-DR on their surface compared with CD34+ CD4- cells, suggesting an immature phenotype.

First, BR-derived Envs demonstrated an enhanced ability to interact with CD4 compared with LN-derived Envs, permitting entry into cells expressing scant levels of CD4.

Most CD4 T cells in RA joints expressed memory/activation markers, such as CD45RO, HLA-DR, and CD69.

In mucosal tissues, CD4(+) T cells express high levels of CCR5, and a subset of these CD4(+)/CCR5(high) cells express the integrin α₄β₇, the gut homing receptor.

Our findings point to a differential regulation in the susceptibility to apoptosis of CD4+T cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR3 and suggest an impairment in the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic deletion of CD4+CCR5+T cells in PPMS patients that may lead to their chronic persistence in peripheral blood from these patients.

Specifically, TA1 was triggered by soluble CD4 more readily than the parental Env and, unlike the parental Env, could mediate entry on cells that express low levels of CD4.

The large number of CD4+ T cells in the gut (a large fraction of which are activated and express the HIV/SIV coreceptor CCR5), the high level of infection of these cells, and the temporal coincidence of this CD4+ T-cell depletion with the peak of virus in plasma in acute infection suggest that the intestinal mucosa may be the major source of virus driving the peak viral load.

These variants are able to exploit low amounts of CD4 and/or CCR5 for infection and potentially confer an expanded tropism for any cell types that express low CD4 and/or CCR5.

Non-mac-tropic R5 envelopes (Envs) require high CD4 levels for infection contrasting with highly mac-tropic Envs, which interact more efficiently with CD4 and mediate infection of macrophages that express low CD4.

IL-12 and IFN-γ make Naive CD4+ T cells highly express T-bet and STAT4 and differentiate to TH1 cells, while IL-4 make Naive CD4+ T cells highly express STAT6 and GATA3 and differentiated to TH2 cells.

Here we show that some fusions of these CCR5- and CD4-mimetic peptides expressed as immunoadhesins, neutralize HIV-1 more efficiently than CD4-Fc or equimolar mixtures of immunoadhesin forms of each peptide.

We performed entry assays using the CD4- and CCR5-inducible Affinofile cell line expressing a range of CD4 levels that approximates the range from MDMs to CD4(+) T cells.

We have previously shown that human defensin 5 (HD5) promotes HIV infectivity in both primary CD4+ T cells and HeLa cells expressing CD4 and CCR5.

We found that the frequency of memory CD4⁺ T cells that expressed high levels of α₄β₇(high) (α₄β₇(high) memory CD4⁺ T cells) in blood before challenge correlated strongly with susceptibility to infection and acute VL.

However, analysis of cervical mononuclear cells showed that DMPA users had elevated levels of activated T cells (CD4+CD69+) and expressed lower levels of the HIV co-receptor CCR5 on a per cell basis, while tissue samples showed that in the ectocervix, DMPA users had a higher proportion of CD4+CCR5+ T cells.

Here, we report that overexpression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 in human CD4⁺ HuT78 cells, SupT1 cells, monocytic THP-1 cells and U87 cells expressing CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4, suppressed entry of CXCR4 tropic viruses NL4.

Access and migration of naive and memory CD4+ T cells to these sites is mediated by interactions between integrin α4β7 expressed on CD4+ T cells, and MAdCAM, expressed on high endothelial venules.

While the percentage of CD4+ T cells from SI biopsies expressed significantly more activation markers (CD38, HLA-DR) and HIV coreceptors (CXCR4, CCR5), the absolute numbers of activated CD4+ T cells were similar between both sites.

In the blood and lymphoid system, the major switch late in disease is from T cells expressing CD4 and CCR5 to T cells expressing CD4 and CXCR4, with a change in coreceptor specificity.

Interestingly, the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of integrin α4β1 and α6β1, whereas integrin α4highβ1+β7+ CD4+ T cells expressed high levels of integrin α4β1 and α4β7, suggesting an alternative expression of integrin α6β1 or α4β7 in combination with α4β1 in respective major and minor populations of integrin α4highCD4+ T cells.

The minor population, integrin α4highβ1+β7+ CD4+ T cells, were different from the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells in that they secreted a smaller amount of Th1 cytokines upon stimulation and expressed lower levels of Th1-related chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 than the integrin α4highβ1highβ7- CD4+ T cells.

R5 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering memory CD4+ T cells, X4 T cell-tropic variants that are adapted to entering naïve CD4+ T cells and Mtropic variants that are adapted to entering macrophages and possibly other cells that express low levels of CD4.

With diminishing CD4+ T cell levels, the capacity to utilize alternate cell types and receptors, including cells that express low CD4 receptor levels such as macrophages, thus becomes crucial.

LAP+CD4+ T cells expressed significantly larger amounts of IL-10 and TGF-β but lower levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-17 and interferon-γ, compared with LAP-CD4+ T cells.

CD25(+) FoxP3(+) memory CD4 T cells, often referred to as regulatory CD4 T cells, depend on IL-2 signaling for homeostatic proliferation in vivo Our results show that CD25(+) FoxP3(+) memory CD4(+) T cells often express the HIV coreceptor CCR5, are significantly more proliferative, and contain more HIV DNA than CD25(-) FoxP3(-) memory CD4 T cell subsets.

In addition, roughly half of these CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells expressed CD69, consistent with resident memory T cells, whereas the remaining CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells lacked CD69 expression, consistent with recirculating memory CD4 T cells that traffic between peripheral tissues and lymphoid sites.

In addition, the number of CD4+ CD25+ cells that expressed the primary receptor CD134 was greater than for CD4+ CD25- cells.

The CD45RA CD45RO subset in culture expressed high levels of CD4, CXCR4, and CD69, an early activation marker, and was highly susceptible to HIV-1 infection and replication.

CD4 and GHOST(3)  expressing CD4 and CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, CXCR4, CXCR6 or BOB.

Furthermore, a CD4-independent R5 HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein was able to kill CD4-negative target cells expressing CCR5, demonstrating that CD4 is not intrinsically required for the induction of death.

An adenovirus vector (Ad-CD4) was used to express CD4 in CD4(-) astrocytes and thus confer efficient infection if a functional coreceptor is present.

In contrast, HIV-1 replicates in activated human CD4(+) T cells, monocytes, and metabolically active human cells of a variety of cell types become permissive for HIV-1 replication when transduced to express CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4.

Because CD4 T cells around FDCs in germinal centers express the HIV coreceptor, CXCR4, whereas CD4 lymphocytes in many other sites do not, it prompted the hypothesis that FDCs may increase CXCR4 expression on CD4 T cells, thereby facilitating infection.

Furthermore, CD4(+) CD57(+) germinal center T cells expressed high levels of CXCR4 and supported enhanced entry of X4 HIV compared with other CD4 T cells from the same tissue.

All of the human testicular macrophages expressed the markers CD45 and MAC387 and most also expressed CD4.

Mucosal lymphocytes isolated from normal human intestine expressed CD4 (14, 530 +/- 7970 antibody-binding sites [ ABSs]/cell), CCR5 (2730 +/- 1524 ABSs/cell), and CXCR4 (2507 +/- 1840 ABSs/cell), but intestinal macrophages, which also expressed CD4 (2959 +/- 2695 ABSs/cell), displayed no detectable CCR5 or CXCR4 ABS.

CD4 and GHOST(3)-engineered to express stably CD4 and the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR2b, CCR3, CCR5, or CXCR4, or the orphan receptors BOB/gpr15 or Bonzo/STRL33/TYMSTR.

In the experiments using U87-CD4 cells expressing chemokine receptors, the isolates from patients in the late CDC-II stage infected U87-CD4 cells expressing CXCR4, but not U87-CD4 cells expressing CCR5.

Titers in other, CD4- cell lines expressing various coreceptors of HIV-1 were 100-fold lower than titers obtained in CD4+ cells.

Such particles allowed efficient infection of CD4-positive human T lymphocytes, and, at a lower efficiency, also cells expressing CXCR4 without CD4.

Cytofluorimetric analysis demonstrated that in KG-1 cells, after HHV-6 infection, more than 40 % of cell population became CD4 positive and only in KG-1 cells expressing the CD4+ phenotype, the exposure to r-gp120 masks a significant amount, not only of CD4, but also of both CXCR4 and CCR5 chemokine receptors.

Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) blocked HIV-1(LAI) infection of cells expressing CD4(2D) CXCR4 less efficiently than for cells expressing wild-type CXCR4 and CD4, whereas down-modulation of CXCR4 by SDF-1 was similar for hybrids and wild-type CXCR4.

However, the binding of virion-associated gp120 to cellular CD4 is often weak, and most cell types that are permissive for HIV-1 infection express little CD4.

Sulfated tyrosines contribute to the binding of CCR5 to MIP-1 alpha, MIP-1 beta, and HIV-1 gp120/CD4 complexes and to the ability of HIV-1 to enter cells expressing CCR5 and CD4.

Anti-CD4 mAbs mimicked the effect of gp120, and both anti-CD4 Ab and gp120 caused internalization of CXCR4 in HEK 293 cells provided they also expressed CD4.

Infectivities of T-cell-tropic viruses were analyzed in a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that have distinct quantities of CD4 and in human astroglioma U87MG-CD4 cells that express a large quantity of CD4 and become highly susceptible to infection after transfection with a CXCR-4 expression vector.

Infection of cat CCC/CD4 cells transiently expressing Lestr supported infection by T-cell line-adapted strains including LAI, whereas CCC/CD4 cells expressing CCR5 were sensitive to primary non-SI strains as well as to the molecularly cloned strains SF-162 and JR-CSF.

In addition, introduction of fusin and CD4 into a human cell line, U87MG, that is resistant to HIV-1 induced syncytium formation and to infection by HIV-1 when expressing CD4 alone made this cell line permissive for Env-mediated cell-cell fusion.

Cocultured unfused E6 cells showed a marked decrease in CD4 expression, suggesting the selective recruitment of cells strongly expressing CD4 into syncytia.

We found that transduction mediated by Env proteins of CD4-independent HIV-1 strains increased up to 5.5-fold in cells expressing unglycosylated CXCR4, suggesting that the CXCR4 glycan inhibits CD4-independent X4 virus infection.

The inoculum virus (SIVsm isolate SMM-3) and reisolates obtained early in infection often showed a pronounced CD4-independence since virus production and/or syncytia induction could be detected directly in NP-2 cells expressing CCR5 but not CD4 (CD4-independent-HIGH).

This difference is associated with the expression of the CCR5 co-receptor on approximately 70 % of CD4 T cells in rectosigmoid tissue, whereas in tonsillar tissue it is expressed on fewer than 15 % of CD4 T cells.

CD4 molecules are expressed at the cell surface of lymphocytes and monocytes mainly as monomers, but basal levels of CD4 dimers are also present at the cell surface of these cells.

Specific and efficient gene transfer into CD4/CXCR4 expressing cell lines and stimulated primary human CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes was achieved.

Antibody (IgG, IgG3 binding, and neutralizing) and CD4+ T-cell (expressing interferon-gamma, interleukin-2, and CD40 ligand) responses were evaluated at month 6.5 for all participants and at months 12, 12.5, and 18 for a randomly selected subset.

Previous research has shown that LT-β is produced mainly by CD4⁺T cells in rhesus macaques, while our study found the same level of LT-β expressed by CD4⁺T and CD8⁺T cells in humans.

Induction of association was not mediated by inside-out signaling via the CD4-associated tyrosine kinase p58lck, since it was not inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors herbymicin and genistein, nor by CD45 bridging between CD4 and the associating molecule, since similar patterns of association were detected IN cells expressing different CD45 isoform patterns.

The soluble component was secreted by both CD4 and CD8 T cells, was not unique to CD28 costimulation, and could be neutralized by removal of C-C chemokines (RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha and-1 beta) from the culture supernatants of costimulated CD4 T cells.

Enhanced stimulation of env-specific CD4+ T cell clones by APC expressing the env protein and the CD4-LAMP-1 chimera was readily demonstrated in both cytotoxicity assays and proliferation assays.

Furthermore, cell-surface CD4 down-modulation by phorbol myristate acetate or anti-CD4 mAbs was similar in the two subsets, which express the same amounts of both cell-surface CD4 and CD4-associated p56lck.

In normal brain, CD4 antigen was expressed on perivascular microglial cells, a specialized microglia expressing monocytic markers, whereas in HIV1-infected brain, CD4+ cells were numerous and scattered throughout the whole parenchyma.

At concentrations which readily kill HIV-infected T cells, CD4(178)-PE40 has no observable cytotoxic effects on uninfected human cell lines expressing surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II molecules, and does not interfere with cellular responses known to be dependent on functional association between CD4 and MHC Class II molecules.

We found that T cells infected with viruses expressing Nef alleles from the CD4low SM group expressed significantly higher levels of the CD69, interleukin (IL)-2 and programmed death (PD)-1 receptors than those expressing Nefs from the CD4high group.

Breast milk T cells were predominantly CD45RO(+) HLADR(+) and expressed low levels of CD45RA, CD62L, and CCR7 consistent with an effector memory population.

Lmo2 knockdown decreased CD4 expression, while inhibition of intracellular NOTCH1 or histone deacetylase activity induced CD4 expression.

The findings indicate that HA and CD44 increase in epidermal keratinocytes in the premalignant hyperplasia induced by UV irradiation and stay elevated in dysplasia and SCC, suggesting that the accumulation of hyaluronan and CD44 is an early marker for malignant transformation and may be a prerequisite for tumor formation.

While the therapeutic vaccine primed the tumor-reactive CD8+ CTLs and CD4+ effector T lymphocytes (Teffs) compartment inducing activation, tumor infiltration, and tumor rejection or delay in tumor growth, treatment with Ontak 1 day prior to vaccination resulted in enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell-mediated vaccine-specific immune responses in the periphery.

To test whether the regulatory functions of the induced CD4(+) CD25(high) Treg cells after transplantation require antigen-specific triggering, we analyzed the capacity of induced CD4(+) CD25(high) Treg cells to inhibit the proliferation of conventional CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells in response to T-cell receptor stimulation using donor cells or HLA-mismatched third-party cells in vitro.

These CD4+CD25- T cells were induced to differentiate into CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs through incubating with CD3 and CD28 antibodies, TGF-β, IL-2 and rapamycin in vitro.

Flow cytometry was applied to analyze the expressions of PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, mTGF-β, LAP, CD39, mIL-10 and cIL-10, by the induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs.

(1) The induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs of both healthy controls and SLE patients both highly expressed PD-1.

(4) The expressions of CD39 and mIL-10 displayed scarce significant differences between healthy controls and SLE patients, while the expressions of cIL-10 by the induced CD4+CD25+ T cells and the induced CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Tregs in SLE patients were significantly increased, which were not correlated with SLEDAI.

Moreover, local blockade of the common IL-2R/IL-15R beta-chain reduced NK cell number and IL-2 production by lung CD4(+) CD25(+) and CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells while inducing IL-10- and TGF-beta-producing CD4(+) T cells in the lung.

Anti-CD4 antibodies induce long-term graft survival by incompletely understood mechanisms, and CD4-ligation with HIV gp120-derivatives attenuates interleukin (IL)-2 receptor signaling.

Small CD45RBhigh CD4+ T lymphocytes and activated CD4+ T blasts induced early (6-12 wk posttransfer) and severe disease, while small resting and unfractionated CD4+ T cells or CD45RBlow T lymphocytes induced a late-onset disease 12-16 wk posttransfer.

Furthermore, in a DC:CD4+ T cell co-culture system, blockade of TIM-4 on DC significantly inhibited T helper-2 cell differentiation and facilitated induced CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cell (iTreg) expansion.

Here we have characterized a primary CD4-independent HIV-1 isolate (92 UG046-T8) with a truncated cytoplasmic tail that was able to infect and induce syncytia in primary lymphocytes from human, chimpanzee, and monkey, as well as CD4-negative cell lines from human and monkey.

Infection with CXCR4 and CCR5-tropic HIV requires initial binding to CD4, and chemotaxis induced by the CCR5-tropic envelope has been reported to be strictly dependent on CD4 binding.

We demonstrate that, in contrast to CD4-dependent gp120 signaling via CCR5, envelope signaling through CXCR4 is CD4 independent inducing chemotaxis of both CD4 and CD8 T cells.

The results suggest that immunization with SIV grown in human CD4(+) T cells induces CD8-suppressor factor, RANTES, MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta which may block CCR5 receptors and prevent the virus from binding and fusion to CD4(+) cells.

Physiological activation of CD8-alpha/beta+ CD4- T cell receptor-alpha/beta+ neonatal T cells, including activation by allogeneic dendritic cells induces the accumulation of CD4 messenger RNA and the expression of CD4 Ag on the cell surface.

Both CD40L and LAG-3 have been used as vaccine adjuvants to induce CTL and CD4 Th1 responses.

D2 CD4 T cells induce a strong Th1/CMI pathway that is characterized by IL-2/IFN-γ expression, help for CD8 CTLs, and skewing of dendritic cell (DC) subsets toward CD8a DCs, coupled with reduced CD4 T follicular helper cells and transient B cell help.

These results demonstrate that HDAC1 and HDAC2 maintain integrity of the CD4 lineage by repressing Runx-CBFβ complexes that otherwise induce a CD8(+) effector T cell-like program in CD4(+) T cells.

Furthermore, immunization of HLA-DR transgenic mice with a mixture of the two immunodominant human VP11/12 CD4+ TEM cell epitopes, but not with cryptic epitopes induced HSV-specific polyfunctional IFN-γ-producing CD107ab+ CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity against ocular herpes infection and disease.

Immunization of HLA-DR transgenic mice with a mixture of these two immunodominant CD4+ T cell epitopes induced a robust antiviral CD4+ T cell response in the cornea that was associated with protective immunity against ocular herpes.

In basal culture conditions, CD40 signaling could be induced by the transient establishment of inter-fibroblastic CD40/CD40 ligand (CD40L) functional bridges.

These interacted with the IL-15 receptor complex on CD4(+) T cells, thus activating the Jak3 and STAT5 phosphorylation signalling pathway to induce CD40 ligand expression, T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production.

Although CD40 lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, its ligation induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation, which is necessary for several CD40-mediated events.

Moreover, EGCG alleviates CD4(+) CD45RB(hi) CD25(-) T cell transfer induced colitis with less accumulation of CD4(+) T cells in the colon.

Comparative experiments with two molecular clones of HIV-1 (X4 SF2 and R5 SF162) and two envelope recombinant viruses generated from these viruses showed that R5 viruses (SF162 and the chimeric env-SF162-SF2) caused an extensive depletion of human CD4(+) T cells in SCID mice at both 2 h and 2 weeks after reconstitution, while the X4 viruses (SF2 and the chimeric env-SF2-SF162) induced CD4 T-cell depletion only when infection was performed at the 2-h reconstitution time.

IL-16 binds to CD4 and induces a migratory response in CD4(+) T cells.

Although it has been assumed that CD4 is the sole receptor and that IL-16 induces a comparable migratory response in all CD4(+) T cells, this has not been investigated.

However, when HIV-1-resistant cells expressing CD4 or a coreceptor or lacking both were mixed with HIV-1-susceptible cells and inoculated with HIV-1, all these HIV-1-resistant cells were similarly incorporated into syncytia induced by HIV-1, indicating a CD4- and coreceptor-independent incorporation of HIV-1-resistant cells into syncytia.

Intracellular cytokine assay showed that CD103(+) LDCs induced greater frequencies of CD4(+) T cells producing IFN-γ and IL-17A, whereas CD11b(high) LDCs were more efficient at inducing CD4(+) T cells producing IL-4 and IL-10.

Results reported herein show that S1P stimulation of MTB-infected monocytes (i) inhibits intracellular mycobacterial growth, (ii) enhances phagolysosome maturation and the transit of mycobacteria in MHC class II compartments, (iii) increases the frequency of MTB-specific CD4+CD69+ T cells, expressing the inflammatory homing receptor CCR5, derived from tuberculosis patients and PPD+, BCG naïve, healthy subjects, and (iv) induces IFN-gamma production in CD4+CD69+CCR5+ T cells derived from PPD+ healthy individuals, only.

These results suggest that in HIV infected patients the interaction of gp120 with CD4 induces unresponsiveness of CD4+ T cells to subsequent activation by antigen.

Our findings indicate that HIV-evoked CXCR4 signaling promotes CCR7-dependent CD4 T cell migration by up-regulating CCR7 function, which is likely to be induced by increased formation of CCR7 homo- and CXCR4/CCR7 hetero-oligomers on the surface of CD4 T cells.

Using a coculture model of BM T cells and hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, we observed that BM CD4+ cells from hypoxic mice induced erythroid output more easily, in agreement with the erythroid-enhancing effect observed for Th2-condition-cultured BM CD4+ cells.

spiralis AES- and MES-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) possessed abilities not only to present antigens to sensitized CD4+ T cell to stimulate their proliferation but also to induce naive CD4+ T cells to differentiate to Treg cells secreting IL-10 and TGF-β.

Hispidulin at a concentration up to 50 μM also suppressed IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner without inducing cell death, and without a change in total frequencies of CD4+ T cells among different concentration groups.

In the present study, using an IL-10 deficient mice model, we found that IL-10 deficiency prevented the reduction of splenic lymphocytes (CD45+ cells) induced by PCV2 and promoted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration in lungs through inducting more T cell chemokines (CCL3, CXCL9, and CXCL10).

The CD4 deprivation induced by MnTBAP had functional consequences on CD4-dependent infectious processes or immunological responses as shown in various models, including gene therapy.

Here, we use next-generation sequencing of the αβT cell receptor of CD4(+) T cells from mice stimulated with PSA in comparison with protein antigen simulation and non-immunized controls and found that PSA immunization induced clonal expansion of a small subset of suppressive CD4(+) CD45RB(low) effector/memory T cells.

In contrast to human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) which significantly induced allogeneic T cell activation and proliferation, hiPSCs failed to induce allogeneic CD45+ lymphocyte and CD8+ T cell activation and proliferation but could induce a low level of allogeneic CD4+ T cell proliferation.

In line with this observation, transfer of OVA-loaded CD11c(int) MHCII(hi) DC from Nb-treated mice into naive hosts could sensitize OVA-specific CD4(+) T cells to IL-4 production, whereas transfer of CD11c(int) MHCII(hi) DC from naive mice, or CD11c(hi) MHCII(int) DC from Nb-treated or naive mice induced CD4(+) T cell expansion but no IL-4 production.

Weak stimulation of CD4(+) T cells induces expansion of CD4(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) and can also promote T helper (Th) 2 responses, which have demonstrable beneficial effects on autoimmune diabetes.

DCs exposed to PF had diminished capacity to stimulate allogeneic T cell proliferation and to activate IFN-γ-producing CD4⁺ T cells and induced CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ T cells and IL-10-producing T cell expansion from naïve CD4⁺ T cells.

The role of CD4+ T-cell help was studied in CD4+ T cell-lymphopenic mice, which were either induced by genetic deficiency of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) in CIITA-/- mice, or by antibody-mediated CD4+ cell depletion.

Because the inclusion of CD4 in a vaccine formulation should be avoided, due to potential autoimmune reactions, we engineered small sized CD4 mimetics (miniCD4s) that are poorly immunogenic and do not induce anti-CD4 antibodies.

Pathogenic HIV and SIV infections characteristically deplete central memory CD4(+) T cells and induce chronic immune activation, but it is controversial whether this also occurs after vaccination with attenuated SIVs and whether depletion or activation of CD4(+) T-cell play roles in protection against wild-type virus challenge.

The mechanism of upregulation of A3G mRNA involves interaction between HLA on DC and TCR of CD4(+) T cells, which is ZAP70 and downstream ERK phosphokinase signalling dependent and induces CD40L and A3G mRNA expression in CD4(+) T cells.

Soluble forms of CD4 (sCD4) and small-molecule CD4 mimics (here exemplified by JRC-II-191) also induce these conformational changes in the HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins, but typically inhibit HIV-1 entry into CD4-expressing cells.

Despite mimetic substitutions, including a glycine-to-(d)-proline change, the gp120 conformation induced by CD4M47 was as close or closer to the conformation induced by CD4 as the one induced by the parent CD4M33.

It can be proposed that exposure of resting CD4+ T cells to pathogen-derived products that can engage TLR2 induces the acquisition of an effector-like phenotype in naive and memory CD4+ T lymphocytes, a phenomenon that might result in an acceleration of virus replication, immune dysregulation, and HIV-type 1-mediated disease progression.

Compared to an ADA (R5) gp140, the NL4-3 (X4) construct revealed an overall higher antibody accessibility, which was most pronounced for the CD4 binding site (CD4bs), but also observed for mAbs against CD4 induced (CD4i) epitopes and gp41 mAbs.

Whereas SIV-infected RM show selective numeric preservation of CD4(+) T(SCM), SIV infection induced a complex perturbation of these cells defined by depletion of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T(SCM), increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and high levels of direct virus infection.

Such a piggyback mechanism may provide insight into the formation or presentation of CD4-like antigens from CMV, HTLV, EBV and sperm proteins with class II MHC-like antigens on HIV (gp160 and Nef proteins) and may break immunological tolerance inducing the autoimmunity observed against both CD4+ and class II MHC+ T cells in AIDS patients.

Depletion of Tregs significantly increased the numbers of virus-specific CD4(+) T cells and improved their cytokine production, whereas it induced only very little CD4(+) T cell cytotoxicity.

Given that CD4(+) T cell activation drives the initial burst of viral replication, we explored in macaques whether an oral vaccine comprised of Lactobacillus plantarum, a commensal bacterium that favors immune tolerance, and inactivated simian immunodeficiency virus mac239 (SIVmac239) would induce CD4(+) T cell unresponsiveness/tolerance toward SIV antigens and thereby prevent the establishment of SIV infection.

Thus, while about 60 % of CB CD4+ T cells could efficiently activate STAT6 in response to IL-4, less than 5 % of CB CD4+ T cells were able to activate the JAK/STAT pathway in response to IFN-γ, IL-12 or IL-2.

It is well established that paracrine secretion of anti-viral CCR5 ligands by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells can block the infection of activated CD4+ T cells by R5 and dual-tropic isolates of HIV-1.

This protection is selective for CD4+ T cells that secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands in that activated CD4+ T cells in the same cultures remain infectable with R5 HIV-1.

Additionally, the present study established a physiologically more relevant model of EC interactions with resting CD4+ T cells and further highlighted the importance of investigating the roles of EC in HIV infection and latency in both resting and activated CD4+ T cells.

Despite this central role, the basis for pox-specific CD4+ T cell activation, specifically the origin of the poxvirus-derived peptides (epitopes) that activate CD4+ T cells, remains poorly understood.

We further justify the generalized conditions under which this minimal model holds, implying that a phenotypic switch can even occur when the fraction of activated nave CD4+ T cells increases at a slower rate than the fraction of activated memory CD4+ T cells.

This was observed although recovered CD4(+) T cells contain a high proportion of activated memory CD4(+) T cells, ie, the preferential targets of HIV, and are susceptible to productive infection with CXCR4-tropic HIV.

Envs with two CD4mc bound were activated for infection of CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cells, but the infection of CD4-positive, CCR5-positive cells was inhibited.

Because CXCR4 is the major coreceptor for the highly cytopathic X4-tropic HIV-1 strains, which preferentially replicate in proliferating CD4+ T cells, the ability of anti-CD28 to up-regulate the surface expression of CXCR4 in both resting and activated CD4+ T cells provides one relevant mechanism for the progression of HIV-1 disease.

Although CD4+ T-cell activation has long been shown to promote infection and replication of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV, recent studies have documented that not all activated CD4+ T cells from human and nonhuman primates are susceptible to infection with HIV/SIV, respectively.

Furthermore, we also demonstrate that in resting CD4 T cells, actin polymerization can be triggered through transient treatment with a pharmacological agent, okadaic acid, that activates LIMK and promotes HIV latent infection of resting CD4 T cells.

Specificity of the decoy was demonstrated by its ability to directly block Stat6 binding to a cis-element probe and transactivation, but not affect Stat6 tyrosine phosphorylation or expression of the IL-4 receptor chains.

We show that an inhibitor of protein phosphatases (PPs) PP1/PP2A, calyculin A, induces (i) phosphorylation of STAT3 on serine and threonine residues, (ii) inhibition of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity, and (iii) relocation of STAT3 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Restimulation of Th1 or Th2 cells via CD3 plus CD28 induced production of IFN-gamma or IL-4, respectively, but did not alter the activation status/DNA binding activity of STATs.

Although expression of the Jak3 tyrosine kinase in T lymphocytes has been thought to be restricted to mature activated cells, mutations of Jak3 can lead to the development of a human severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) characterized by an absence of peripheral T lymphocytes.

In this study, we attempted to find a new target for JAK that is directly activated by JAK, independent of gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation, by using a yeast two-hybrid system.

To determine whether JAKs play a role in activating a signal transduction pathway different from the classical JAK/STAT pathway, we analyzed the ability of huIL-4 to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of one of its major cellular substrates, the insulin receptor substrate (IRS).

Thus, the box1 domain of the Epo-R specifies Jak2 activation and functions efficiently within a heterologous IL2 receptor complex that normally activates Jak1 and Jak3.

In addition, IL-4 and IL-7 induced the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 and JAK1, and IL-4 activated both JAK3 and JAK1 phosphotransferase activity.

Nonetheless, a membrane-proximal region of human IL-2R beta (Asn240-Leu335) was critical for JAK3 activation, and the amount of JAK3 present in activated IL-2 receptor complexes increased with time, suggesting that stabilization of JAK3 binding to the receptor complex relies on both IL-2R beta and IL-2R gamma.

The observation that IL-2 and IFN alpha activate JAK1 to a comparable degree, but only IFN alpha activates STAT1, indicates that JAK1 activation is not the only determining factor for STAT1 activation.

We now find that LCLs transformed by EBV recombinants that express Flag-LMP1 with the putative JAK3 binding and activating intermediate domain deleted and LCLs transformed by Flag-LMP1 EBV recombinants have similar levels of phosphotyrosine-activated JAK3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), or STAT5 and similar very low levels of JAK3 associated with LMP1.

Although these data indicate that the LMP1 putative JAK3 binding and activating intermediate domain does not mediate JAK3 association or activation in B-lymphocytes, JAK3 association with LMP1 could be significant, particularly in cells in which LMP1, JAK3, or a JAK3-associated protein is expressed at high levels.

These results also document that the requirement for interaction between gammac and JAK3 is different to activate different signaling pathways mediated by gammac, such as c-fos, c-myc, and JAK-STAT.

For signal transduction through IL-4R and IL-13R, we have demonstrated that in nonhematopoietic cells, Janus protein tyrosine kinase (JAK) 2 is phosphorylated and activated instead of JAK3 tyrosine kinase.

Although JAK3(V674A) and the majority of other JAK3 mutants needed to bind to a functional cytokine receptor complex to constitutively activate STAT5, JAK3(L857P) was unexpectedly found to not depend on such receptor complexes for its activity, which was induced without receptor or JAK1 co-expression.

Indeed, cells that originally showed a JAK1-activating mutation became resistant to inhibitors by acquiring another activating mutation in JAK3, whereas cells that originally showed a JAK3-activating mutation became resistant to inhibitors by acquiring another activating mutation in JAK1.

Protein modeling and homology analyses of mutations present in other members of the JAK family suggested that these mutations likely activate JAK3, possibly by disrupting the activation loop and the interface between N and C lobes, increasing the accessibility of the catalytic loop.

Among the transcription factors that are known to be activated by JAK3, we explored the phenotype of Stat6-deficient DCs which is a transcription factor specifically activated by JAK3.

As to the molecular signaling cascade linking AMPK to STAT3, we disclosed that AMPK suppressed STAT3 not only by attenuating JAK signaling but also by activating nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2), a redox-regulating transcription factor, which consequently increased the expression of small heterodimer protein (SHP), thus repressing the transcriptional activity of STAT3.

As expected for cytokines that use gammac, recent studies indicate that IL-21 induces Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and JAK3 activation to initiate signal transduction, but unlike these other gammac-dependent cytokines, which predominantly activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), IL-21 preferentially activates STAT1 and STAT3.

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) activates the receptor-associated Janus family tyrosine kinases, Jak1 and Jak3, which in turn phosphorylate and activate specific STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription), such as STAT5.

These results indicate that STATs are activated through cytokine receptors by two distinct mechanisms, one dependent on receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and the other mediated by the JAK-STAT direct interaction.

We also provide evidence that the IRS pathway is independent of STAT-6, showing that JAK1 is essential for activating a STAT-independent pathway.

These data suggest that STATs can be activated directly by Bcr/Abl, possibly bypassing JAK family kinase activation.

These results clearly indicated that gamma c is essential for activation of Jak3 and STAT6 in the signal transduction pathway of IL-4 in human B cells and that IL-13 does not utilize gamma c but activates STAT6 through an alternative pathway, which is not impaired in B cells of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency patients.

Less efficient interactions between R5X4 strains and CCR5 may be responsible for the inability to use CCR5 on lymphocytes, which express relatively low CCR5 levels.

So far, in vitro selection for variants resistant to the CCR5 antagonist SCH-C in PBMC (which express both CCR5 and CXCR4) has resulted in mutants that were resistant to the blocker but still used CCR5.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that HHV-6 increases the production of the CCR5 ligand RANTES (\ regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted\), the most potent HIV-inhibitory CC chemokine, and that exogenous RANTES mimics the effects of HHV-6 on HIV-1, providing a mechanism for the selective blockade of CCR5-tropic HIV-1.

The absence of CCR5 on intestinal macrophages was not due to expression of the Delta32 deletion allele because matched-blood monocytes expressed CCR5.

HeLa cells were transfected with plasmid constructs that carry the SIV or SIV-MuLV chimeric Env protein genes and were overlaid with either CEMx174 cells or Ghost Gpr15 cells, which express the Gpr15 coreceptor for SIV, or Ghost CCR5 cells, which express CCR5, an alternate coreceptor for SIV.

Similarly, CCR5 protein, the major macrophage-tropic HIV-1 coreceptor, was not expressed in freshly isolated HPCB CD34+AC133+ stem cells, although the transcript for CCR5 was identified in these cells.

In wt/del individuals, del CCR5 mRNA was expressed at 10-fold greater levels than wt CCR5 mRNA in unstimulated PBMCs from the same individual.

In contrast, both macrophage-tropic SIVmac316 and T cell-tropic SIVmac239, which in addition to CD4 require CCR5 coreceptor for entry, significantly enhanced early MEK/ERK, p38 MAPK, and JNK signaling in Jurkat cells expressing constitutively or transiently the CCR5 receptor.

Viral Env utilization of CCR5 expressed on 293-T cells does not always correlate with the cellular tropism of the virus, and one possible explanation is that Env-accessible interaction sites on CCR5 differ on different cell types.

We therefore analyzed binding of several anti-CCR5 monoclonal antibodies to cell lines and primary cells that express this chemokine receptor and found that whereas all antibodies bound to CCR5-transfected 293 T cells, several did not bind to PBMC.

We also studied whether dualtropic primary isolates (able to use both CCR5 and CXCR4) were differentially sensitive to neutralization by the same antibodies when entering U87MG-CD4 cells stably expressing either CCR5 or CXCR4.

We highlight evidence supporting the hypothesis that enhanced M-tropism of R5 HIV-1 results from adaptive viral evolution, resulting in HIV-1 variants that have increased ability to utilise relatively low levels of CCR5 expressed on macrophages, by way of increased CCR5 affinity.

Interestingly, even though CCR5 is expressed on far fewer T cells than is CXCR4, many patients in early- and late-stage HIV disease maintain high levels of CCR5-tropic (R5) viruses.

Although several of the analyzed receptors (including CCR6, CCR7, CXCR4, and CXCR5) were not differentially expressed on gammadelta vs alphabeta T cells, gammadelta T cells expressed strongly increased levels of the RANTES/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/-1beta receptor CCR5 and also enhanced levels of CCR1-3 and CXCR1-3.

Sustained infection by viruses encoding the V3-to-V5 region of V1CSF was detected in CrFK cells expressing human CCR3 or CCR5 but not in cells expressing CXCR4 alone, while all CrFK cell lines were permissive to viruses encoding the V3-to-V5 region of Petaluma.

An indium (111 In)-labeled CXCR4 antagonist peptide, [ 111 In]Ac-TZ14011, discussed in a separate chapter of MICAD (9), was developed for the scintigraphic imaging of xenograft tumors that express CXCR4 in mice, and its biodistribution was also investigated in the animals (10).

As CXCR4 is highly expressed on GICs and glioma tumor sites, meanwhile, the activation of CXCR4 induces the receptor-stimulated macropinocytosis pathway in GICs, this CXCR4 receptor-stimulated lipoprotein-like nanoparticle (SLNP) achieves efficient accumulation in GICs in vitro and in vivo.

CXCL12, the natural ligand for CXCR4, and the small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, bound the proteoliposomes with affinities close to those associated with the binding of these molecules to cells expressing CXCR4 and CD4.

Follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) up-regulate the chemokine receptor CXCR4 on CD4 T cells, and a major subpopulation of germinal center (GC) T cells (CD4(+) CD57(+)), which are adjacent to FDCs in vivo expresses high levels of CXCR4.

We therefore reasoned that GC T cells would actively migrate to stromal cell-derived factor-1 (CXCL12), the CXCR4 ligand, and tested this using Transwell migration assays with GC T cells and other CD4 T cells (CD57(-)) that expressed much lower levels of CXCR4.

However, the binding of R5 gp120 to N11Q-CXCR4 and entry of R5 HIV-1 viruses into cells expressing N11Q-CXCR4 were 20-and 100-to 1000-fold less efficient, respectively, than the levels achieved using X4 gp120 or X4 HIV-1 viruses.

New directions on CKR-5 research are discussed, such as antagonizing the CKR-5 receptor as a treatment option, testing more people for the defective CKR-5 gene, whether CKR-5 is involved in the rare cases of persons who are HIV-negative, and whether people with one defective gene in the CKR-5 receptor molecule progress more slowly in the disease.

Because CCR5 mediates Treg homing and proliferation, we determined the outcome of antagonizing TNF-α in CCR5(-/) (-) mice infected with Histoplasma capsulatum.

The entry pathway affected was CCR5 dependent, as antagonizing CCR5 with the small molecule inhibitor TAK779 completely blocked entry.

The chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 are required for HIV-1 to enter cells, and the progression of HIV-1 infection to AIDS involves a switch in the co-receptor usage of the virus from CCR5 to CXCR4.

Viral resistance to small molecule allosteric inhibitors of CCR5 is well documented, and involves either selection of preexisting CXCR4-using HIV-1 variants or envelope sequence evolution to use inhibitor-bound CCR5 for entry.

Our results indicate that a likely mechanism for ligand-directed sorting of CCR5 involves capacity of the chemokine analogs to elicit the formation of durable complexes of CCR5 and arrestin2 (beta-arrestin-1), with PSC-RANTES eliciting durable association in contrast to 5 P14-RANTES, which elicits only transient association.

As it was previously demonstrated that C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) may be involved in inflammatory migration of DCs, the aim of this study was to investigate CCR5-driven migration of tolDCs.

Considering the " renaissance of CCR5 research" this article is useful for updating researchers who develop studies involving CCR5 and CCR5Δ32 in different infectious diseases.

C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) 5 (CCR5) is the main HIV-1 coreceptor involved in virus entry and cell-to-cell spread during acute and chronic infections: such CCR5 and T cell tropic viruses are adapted to and replicate in CD4+ memory T cells.

T-cell surface CCR5 density, which is constant over time for a given individual, but varies drastically among individuals, might therefore be an important personal determinant of T-cell migration in many biological situations where CCR5-binding chemokines play a role, such as graft rejection, T helper 1-mediated auto-immune diseases, and infectious diseases involving CCR5.

In summary, we have shown that CCR5 is mechanistically involved in dissemination of gastric cancer cells, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors of CCR5 might be exploited for their anticancer potential.

In addition, examination of chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) genotype, recently reported as involved in severe influenza virus disease, revealed that the F virus-infected patient was homozygous for the deleted form of CCR5 receptor (CCR5Δ32).

On the basis of the possibility that a MOR-CCR5 heteromer is involved in such cross-talk, we have synthesized bivalent ligands (MCC series) that contain mu opioid agonist and CCR5 antagonist pharmacophores linked through homologous spacers (14-24 atoms).

Interaction of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120/CD4 complex involves its amino-terminal domain (Nt-CCR5) and requires sulfation of two to four tyrosine residues in Nt-CCR5.

We found that (i) these receptors expressed alone are confined into 1-microm-sized domains, (ii) CD4-CCR5 associations occur outside and inside smaller domains, and (iii) these interactions involve multiple CCR5 molecules per CD4.

Small-molecule CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc (MVC), likely block HIV-1 through an allosteric, noncompetitive inhibition mechanism, whereas inhibition by agonists such as PSC-RANTES is less defined and may involve receptor removal by cell surface downregulation, competitive inhibition by occluding the HIV-1 envelope binding, and/or allosteric effects by altering CCR5 conformation.

We have recently demonstrated that the CCR5Delta32 protein interacts with CCR5 and CXCR4 and down-modulates their cell surface expression.

The structural basis for CCR5 coreceptor function has been studied in a limited number of prototype strains and suggests that R5 and R5X4 Envs interact differently with CCR5.

In contrast to previous reports in which CCR5 antagonist-resistant viruses interact predominantly with the N terminus of CCR5, these MVC-resistant Envs were also dependent upon the drug-modified ECLs of CCR5 for entry.

The crystal structure of CCR5 shows that the aromatic side chains of F189, W190 and F193 point away from the binding pocket and interact with the membrane or with an adjacent CCR5 molecule, and therefore could not interact with gp120 in the intact CCR5 receptor.

We conclude that diverse CCR5 sequences occur in AGMs and mice, that SIVmac251 and macrophage-tropic HIV-1 isolates interact differently with specific CCR5 amino acids, and that multiple regions of human CCR5 contribute to its coreceptor functions.

Genetic experiments suggested that the active traptamers specifically interacted with the transmembrane domains of CCR5 and that some of the traptamers interacted with different portions of CCR5.

Taking the results together, this study identified the molecular basis by which LukED targets CCR5, highlighting the divergent molecular interactions evolved by HIV-1 and LukED to interact with CCR5.

While the molecular interaction of CCR5 and HIV-1 is well characterized, the means by which LukED interacts with CCR5 is less clear.

A calculated docking model for Nt-CCR5(1-27) suggests that residues 2-22 of Nt-CCR5 interact with the bases of V3 and C4, while the C-terminal segment of Nt-CCR5(1-27) points toward the target cell membrane, reflecting an Nt-CCR5 orientation that differs by 180 ° from that of a previous model.

Concerning the mechanism of inhibition of the Gal-AMD3100 conjugates, experiments performed with X4 or R5HIV-1 strains and GHOST cells genetically modified to express CD4 and CXCR4 or CCR5 indicated clearly that the conjugates interact with CXCR4 and not with CCR5.

A comparison between the CCL5 : CCR5 and the HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop : CCR5 complex structures depicts that both the chemokine and the virus primarily interact with the same CCR5 residues.

It has previously been demonstrated that there are two distinct mechanisms for genetic resistance to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) conferred by the CCR5Delta32 gene: the loss of wild-type CCR5 surface expression and the generation of CCR5Delta32 protein, which interacts with CXCR4.

However, virus breakthrough was observed earlier in the presence of CCR5-targeting agents than in presence of reverse transcriptase inhibitors and was associated with a change in sensitivity to TAK-779 or AMD3100, virus coreceptor expansion to CXCR4 and changes in the V3 loop region of gp120.

Viral selection of CCR5 is associated with the early stages of infection, and transition to selection of CXCR4 indicates disease progression.

In this study, we examined the expression of Th1 associated chemokine and cytokine receptors CXCR3, CCR5, and interleukin (IL)-12 R, IL-18R, respectively, as well as of the Th2 associated chemokine receptors CCR4 and CXCR4 on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.

Following the cross-linking of CCR5, monocytes synthesized high levels of M-CSF, RANTES, MIP-1 alpha, and MIP-1 beta associated with a readily detectable down modulation of CD14, CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 expression.

These are important questions to consider given the development of new CCR5 blocking therapies and the prognosis associated with CXCR4 use.

In this study, HIV-1 populations that maintained CCR5 usage during infection were compared with populations that switched coreceptor usage to include CXCR4 later during infection, with the aim to find molecular properties of the virus populations associated with the CCR5-to-CXCR4 switch.

CCR5 (R5) tropic viruses are associated with early stages of infection, whereas CXCR4 (X4) HIV-1 tropism has been associated with severe immunodeficiency.

The co-receptor CCR5 is associated with primary infection by macrophage-tropic virus isolates, whereas CXCR4 is commonly associated with T cell- and dual-tropic viruses.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) variants are associated with faster disease progression than CCR5-tropic variants in HIV infection.

However, the presence of viruses able to use CXCR4 for entry was marginally associated with the CCR5 Δ32 genotype in the nongenome-wide analysis.

Moreover, in most instances CXCR4 use as viral entry co-receptor is associated with maintenance of CCR5 use.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) HIV-1 variants are associated with faster disease progression compared with CCR5-tropic variants.

Six of the isolates exhibited syncytia induction (SI) associated with CXCR4 coreceptor usage while three of the isolates were non-syncytia-inducing (NSI) isolates associated with CCR5 coreceptor usage.

To test whether a block to CCR5 promotes the replication of viruses that enter cells via CXCR4 and are associated with accelerated disease progression, we administered a small molecule CCR5 inhibitor, CMPD 167, to three macaques dual-infected with both R5 (SIVmac251) and X4 (SHIV-89.

Human immunodeficiency viruses initiate infections via CCR5 coreceptors and then change their tropism to C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), this change being associated with rapid disease progression.

In this review, we focus on some of the key issues that are emerging now that CCR5 has been validated as a promising target for HIV prevention strategies and at a time when a CCR5 inhibitor has been approved in the United States as the first in a new class of anti-HIV therapeutic drugs.

Here, we report that multiple CXCR4-using variants of a parental CCR5-using HIV-1 isolate, SF162, obtained by either target cell selection or CCR5 inhibition have a common mutation pattern characterized by the same two V3 mutations and that these mutations preexisted in some of the SF162 stocks.

CCR5 may be the more suitable co-receptor target for small-molecule antagonists because a natural deletion in the CCR5 gene preventing its expression on the cell surface is not associated with any obvious phenotype, but can confer resistance to infection by CCR5-tropic strains-the most frequently sexually-transmitted strains.

The specificity of this effect was demonstrated by the inhibition of fusion by CXCR4-tropic and dual-tropic (CXCR4 and CCR5) envelope glycoproteins from HIV-1 on CXCR4+ indicator cells, but the lack of effects by siRNAs targeting CXCR4 mRNA on dual-tropic HIV-1 envelopes in CCR5+ indicator cells utilizing these fusion assays.

This points to a different mechanism of CCR5 usage by these viruses and may have important implications for the development of HIV-1 inhibitors that target CCR5 coreceptor function.

The second extracellular loop (ECL2) domain of CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) has been proposed as a specific target site for therapeutic agents aimed at blocking CCR5-dependent entry by human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1).

Finally, we identified residues in the predicted CCR5 dimer interface that are mandatory for gp120 binding, suggesting that receptor dimerization might represent a target for new CCR5 entry inhibitors.

The current review enlightens the recent updates in the structural biology of the viral envelope and focuses on CCR5 as a validated target as well as ways to overcome CCR5 resistance.

CCR5 co-receptor antagonists, maraviroc, prevent HIV entry into target cells by binding to CCR5 receptors.

Like SCH-C, vicriviroc binds specifically to the CCR5 receptor and prevents infection of target cells by CCR5-tropic HIV-1 isolates.

Furthermore, the same C1-expressing cells that were protected from R5 strain Ba-L retained susceptibility to X4 strain IIIB, which uses CXCR4 as the coreceptor instead of CCR5, suggesting that the RNase P-mediated cleavage induced by the EGS is specific for the target CCR5 but not the closely related CXCR4.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 acts as a co-receptor for HIV binding and it is considered as an important target by CCR5 antagonists.

Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from a CCR5Δ32/Δ32 donor was previously successful in eliminating HIV from the recipient\s immune system, suggesting that targeted CCR5 disruption can lead to an HIV cure.

The wealth of CCR5-related tools that have been developed during the intensive investigation of CCR5 as an HIV drug target can now be turned towards the study of CCR5 as a model chemokine receptor.

Finally, we discuss the potential of CCR5 as a drug target for diseases other than HIV, discussing the evidence linking CCR5 and its natural chemokine ligands with inflammatory diseases, particularly neuroinflammation, and certain cancers.

In this paper, we provide recent insights into the role of CCR5 and its ligands in metabolic syndrome as related to cardiovascular disease and the opportunities and roadblocks in targeting CCR5 and its ligands.

CCR5 is well known as a target for HIV therapy where its blockade is efficient and safe, it is also known that its mutation CCR5delta32 is for the most part non-pathological to its carriers.

The chemokine CCR5 receptor is target of maraviroc, a negative allosteric modulator of CCR5 that blocks the HIV protein gp120 from associating with the receptor, thereby inhibiting virus cellular entry.

Moreover, after short incubation and subsequent washout, a significant down-modulation of CCR5 was only seen with the fusion proteins and only on CD4+ cells, but not with unmodified RANTES or on CD4- cells, indicating a preferential targeting of CCR5 on CD4+ T cells.

Conversely, the transfer of CCR5(-/-) donor cells to nonirradiated recipients led to reduced infiltration of target organs, confirming previous studies and demonstrating that the role of CCR5 on donor T cells is dependent on conditioning of recipients.

These data clearly indicate that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM that are homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and, while the extent of alternative coreceptor use in SM with CCR5 wild type alleles is uncertain, strongly suggest that SIVsmm tropism and host cell targeting in vivo is defined by the distribution and use of alternative entry pathways in addition to CCR5.

SIVsmm entry through alternative pathways in vivo raises the possibility of novel CCR5-negative target cells that may be more expendable than CCR5+ cells and enable the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of extremely restricted CCR5 expression seen in SM and several other natural host species.

Although data from macaque studies suggest that CCR5+ CD4+ T cells are initial targets for HIV-1 infection, the impact of semen on T cell CCR5 expression and ligand production remains inconclusive.

As a first step toward achieving this goal, an HIV-1-susceptible cell-specific targeting vector was evaluated to selectively transfer, into CCR5-positive target cells, an anti-HIV CCR5 shRNA gene for subsequent knockdown of CCR5 expression and protection from HIV-1 infection.

These anti-CCR3 transgenes were compared to SFv-CCR5, an SFv against CCR5, and RNAi-R5, an RNAi that targets CCR5, for the ability to protect primary human brain microglia and MDM from infection with peripheral and neurotropic strains of HIV-1.

To better understand the functional role of CCR5 during leishmania infection, RNA interference strategy has been used to modulate macrophage function by targeting the expression of CCR5 gene.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of CCR5 and CXCR3 in allergen-induced acute asthma and to determine whether a novel small-molecule compound, TAK-779 targeting CCR5 and CXCR3 can attenuate allergic airway responses.

Fullly major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched murine islet transplant models were used to test the in vivo effect of PNA CCR5 by targeting CCR5 in acute allograft rejection.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 is an attractive target for HIV-1 drug development, as individuals whose cells lack surface CCR5 expression are highly resistant to HIV-1 infection.

Although CCR5 might be a logical target for new drug development in HIV/AIDS, the benefits of blocking CCR5 could carry the cost of an increased risk of WNV disease in co-infected patients.

We conclude that CCR5 plays a key role in the mechanisms of host T cell and macrophage recruitment and allograft rejection, such that targeting of CCR5 clinically may be of therapeutic significance.

We conclude that the second extracellular loop of CCR5 is an ideal target site for the development of inhibitors of either chemokine or HIV-1 binding to CCR5.

Since HIV requires CD4 and a co-receptor, most commonly C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), for cellular entry targeting CCR5 expression is an attractive approach for therapy of HIV infection.

These findings imply that implementing a CCR5-Ig-based therapy would be advantageous over blockade of this receptor or of the use of mAbs for targeting a single CCR5 ligand.

MCC22 consists of mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist pharmacophores connected through a 22-atom spacer and was designed to target a putative MOR-CCR5 heteromer localized in pain processing areas.

In earlier studies we have shown that CCL5 activation of CCR5 induces the proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells in a mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-dependent manner and that this is in part due to CCR5-mediated increases in glycolytic metabolism.

CCR5 is one of the receptors targeted by LukED and is the major coreceptor for CCR5-tropic HIV-1.

In summary, CCR5 regulates recruitment of blood leukocytes into the colon indicating that targeting CCR5 may offer therapeutic options in IBDs.

The efficacy of this approach relies on efficient biallelic disruption of CCR5, and the ability to efficiently target sequences that confer HIV resistance to the CCR5 locus has the potential to further improve clinical outcomes.

These findings indicate the importance of CKR-5 in HIV-1 transmission and suggest that targeting the HIV-1-CKR-5 interaction may provide a means of preventing or slowing disease progression.

Since antiviral agents preventing CCR5 utilization by the virus are already in use, while others targeting either CCR5 or CXCR4 (or both) are under investigation, understanding the biological correlates of this " asymmetrical" utilization of HIV entry co-receptors bears relevance for the clinical choice of which therapeutics should be administered to infected individuals.

To directly measure how KLF2 affects CCR5 regulation, we introduced small interfering RNA targeting KLF2 expression and demonstrated that reduced KLF2 expression also resulted in less CCR5.

These results indicate that (i) AGMs are readily infected with SIVagm by both intrarectal and intravaginal routes, (ii) susceptibility to infection is proportional to the number of available CCR5(+) CD4(+) target cells in the mucosa, and (iii) the paucity of CCR5(+) CD4(+) target cells in infant and juvenile AGMs may explain the near absence of vertical transmission.

Our estimate of the threshold surface density of gp120-CCR5 complexes necessary for HIV-1 entry thus appears robust and may have implications for optimizing treatment with coreceptor antagonists, understanding the non-pathogenic infection of non-human primates, and designing vaccines that suppress the availability of target CD4(+) CCR5(+) cells.

However, the R5X4 intermediate virus entered CCR5-expressing target cells less efficiently than the parental R5 strain and was more sensitive to both CCR5 and CXCR4 inhibitors than either the parental R5 or the final X4 virus.

Characterizing the link between the function and dynamics of CCR5 populations has implications for understanding their selective targeting by HIV-1 and for the development of inhibitors that will block CCR5 utilization by the virus.

CCR5 is a reasonable but not absolutely protective target for a cure of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, because CCR5-null blood cells are largely resistant to HIV-1 entry.

C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is the main co-receptor for HIV entry into the target CD4+ cells, and homozygous CCR5Δ32/Δ32 cells are resistant to CCR5-tropic HIV infection.

In previous studies we demonstrated the utility of an anti-CCR5 ribozyme targeted to a single cleavage site in downregulating CCR5 expression and consequently providing resistance to viral infection.

To improve on the level of downregulation we designed a construct containing an anti-CCR5 ribozyme heterotrimer (R5RbzTM) targeted to three different cleavage sites in CCR5 mRNA.

Polymorphisms in the CCR5 gene that reduce CCR5 expression levels, protect against disease progression, suggesting that drugs targeted to CCR5 could be effective.

Mutated envelopes with some preservation of entry function on either CCR5- or CXCR4-expressing target cells were further characterized for their sensitivity to CCR5 or CXCR4 inhibitors, soluble CD4, and the neutralizing antibodies b12-IgG and 40000000000.0.

In view of CCR5\s importance as a therapeutic target for the treatment of HIV, this observation provides novel insight into the β-arrestin/CCR5 pathway.

As proof-of-concept, since CCR5 is considered a major silencing target of HIV therapy, CCR5-siRNA nanocapsules were delivered into 293 T cells and successfully downregulated the CCR5 RNA fused with mCherry reporter RNA.

Our findings suggest that targeting CCR2/CCR5 should provide greater efficacy than targeting CCR2 or CCR5 alone, and that dual CCR2/CCR5 antagonist RAP-103 has the potential for broad clinical use in neuropathic pain treatment.

Clonal analysis of viral isolates from a limited number of patients revealed that these CXCR4-tropic strains did not develop by mutation of a CCR5-tropic virus during therapy, but emerged from a minor population of CXCR4-tropic variants already present in the patients at baseline.

To trace the evolutionary patterns underlying evolution of coreceptor use within a host, we studied an HIV-1 transmission pair involving a donor who exclusively harbored CCR5-using (R5) variants throughout his entire disease course and a recipient who developed CXCR4-using variants.

A homology model of CCR5 was developed based on the recently reported CXCR4 structure as template.

AIDS-associated, CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 clones, isolated from a patient that never developed CXCR4-tropic HIV-1, replicate to a greater extent and cause greater cytopathic effects than R5 HIV-1 clones isolated before the onset of AIDS.

The study shows that implication of peptide carriers modified with CXCR4 ligand is a promising approach to develop targeted siRNA delivery system into CXCR4-expressing cancer and endothelial cells.

In an effort to develop imaging probes for CXCR4, we developed a novel small molecule CXCR4-targeted PET agent (compound 5) by combining our established benzenesulfonamide scaffold with a labeling component by virtue of click chemistry.

The positive expression rate of CXCR4 and MMP-2 was 68.5 % and 54.8 % respectively, and of the 45 patients who developed distal metastasis, 33 and 28 patients had positive expression of CXCR4 and MMP-2 respectively.

To quantify CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in cell-based assays and living mouse models of ovarian cancer, we developed a click beetle red luciferase complementation reporter that detects activation of CXCR4 based on recruitment of the cytosolic adapter protein β-arrestin 2.

An 111 In-labeled CXCR4 antagonist peptide, 111 In-Ac-TZ14011, has been developed for SPECT imaging of CXCR4 expression in xenograft tumors in mice (9).

Here, for the first time, AMD3100 (AMD), a CXCR4-receptor antagonist, was coformulated with sulfotanshinone IIA sodium (STS IIA) into a liposome (STS-AMD-Lips) to develop a CXCR4 receptor targeting form of combination therapy for PF.

We developed a novel CXCR4-targeted near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe (Peptide R-NIR750) conjugating the new developed CXCR4 peptidic antagonist Peptide R with the NIR fluorescent dye VivoTag-S750.

An indium (111 In)-labeled CXCR4 antagonist, [ 111 In]-Ac-TZ14011, was developed for the imaging of CXCR4 expression in xenograft tumors in mice, and Hanaoka et al.

This receptor seems to be very important in disease transmission, whereas CXCR4 receptor tends to be used by the viral strains that emerge later in the disease in addition to or instead of the CCR5.

In 50 % of progressing HIV-1 patients, CXCR4-tropic (X4) virus emerges late in infection, often overtaking CCR5-tropic (R5) virus as the dominant viral strain.

Phylogenetic analysis of envelope (Env) clones from pre- and posttreatment time points indicated that the CXCR4-using variants probably emerged by outgrowth of a pretreatment CXCR4-using reservoir, rather than via coreceptor switch of a CCR5-tropic clone under selection pressure from maraviroc.

CXCR4 (X4) strains emerged in each patient but were suppressed following initiation of new antiretroviral regimens, so that CCR5-utilizing (R5) strains predominated.

" Recent discoveries have determined that macrophage-tropic strains of HIV-1 which are largely responsible for sexual transmission require the beta-chemokine receptor CCR5 in addition to CD4, while the T cell tropic viruses that emerge later after infection use the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4.

Inferring an evolutionary tree from the 1674 unique reads that span the V3 region confirms that the CXCR4-using population emerged from low-frequency CXCR4-using variants present before treatment.

We determined that the first mutations contributing to CXCR4 use emerged about 16 (per subject range 4 to 30) months before the earliest predicted CXCR4-using ancestor, which preceded the first positive cell-based assay of CXCR4 usage by 10 (range 5 to 25) months.

Taken together, CXCR4-using variants at late-stage infection are likely to emerge when replication-competent CXCR4-using variants are maintained as a minor population during the course of infection.

In this study, we used sequential primary isolates and recombinant strains of HIV-1 to demonstrate that CXCR4-using (X4) viruses emerging in association with disease progression are highly pathogenic in ex vivo lymphoid tissues compared to CXCR4-independent viruses.

But emergence of CXCR4-tropic viruses on therapy may require a critical threshold of CXCR4 viral load at baseline, which may not be the case in patients with a very low proportion of CXCR4-using variants.

However, changes at specific V3 positions were prerequisite for persistence of CXCR4-using variants in vivo, suggesting that positive selection targeting the V3 loop is required for emergence of CXCR4-using variants during natural disease course.

In contrast, basic amino acid substitutions at position 25, or substitutions at positions 6-8 resulting in the loss of a potential N-linked glycosylation site, contributed to CXCR4-mediated entry but required additional substitutions acting cooperatively to confer efficient CXCR4 use.

We found that the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of CXCR4 and specifically phosphorylation of Ser-339 within this region were required for TCR-CXCR4 complex formation.

These data suggest that the interaction of gp120 with CD4 or CXCR4 is required for efficient inhibition of ADA binding to CD26, although in the presence of CXCR4 the interaction of gp120 with CD4 may be dispensable.

Our results indicate that Cxcr4a is required for Hh-dependent cell proliferation but not for Hh-dependent patterning, and suggest that the parallel activation of Cxcr4a is required to modulate the Hh pathway to distinguish between patterning and proliferation.

Using S1P5(-/-) mice and a new knockin mouse model in which CXCR4 cannot be desensitized (a mouse model of warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis [ WHIM] syndrome), we demonstrate that NK-cell exit from the BM requires both CXCR4 desensitization and S1P5 engagement.

Taken together, we demonstrated that CXCR4 plays a crucial role in tumor angiogenesis required for OSCC progression, whereas TAITN induced by CXCR4 antagonism could be an effective anti-angiogenic therapeutic strategy in OSCC treatment.

Notably, chemotaxis toward both proteins is CXCR4-dependent but, in contrast to fr-HMGB1, 3 S does not require CXCL12 since hcFbs migration persists in the presence of the CXCL12/CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 or an anti-CXCL12 antibody.

Thus, SIVmac239 can acquire the ability to use CXCR4 with high efficiency, but the changes required for this phenotype may be distinct from those for HIV-1 CXCR4 use.

Using CXCR4 chimeras and mutants, we determined that SDF-1 requires the CXCR4 amino terminus for binding and activates downstream signaling pathways by interacting with the second extracellular loop of CXCR4.

SDF-1-mediated activation of CXCR4 required the Asp-Arg-Tyr motif in the second intracellular loop of CXCR4, was pertussis toxin sensitive, and did not require the distal C-terminal tail of CXCR4.

In addition, while the V4 or the V5 region of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 failed to confer the capacity to utilize CXCR4 on HIV-1(AD8), these regions were required in conjunction with regions V1 to V3 of HIV-1(DH12) gp120 for efficient utilization of CXCR4.

Using mink lung epithelial cells expressing CXCR4 and a COOH-terminal deletion mutant of CXCR4, we found that an intact cytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain was required for both PMA and ligand-induced CXCR4 endocytosis.

- APE strongly induced expression and function of CXCR4 and reduced CCR1 and CCR5 expression on immature DCs.

Mutagenesis studies of Env amino acid variants influencing coreceptor usage showed that S306 in the gp120 V3 region of brain-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CCR5 N terminus and enhances CCR5 usage for HIV-1 entry into PBMC and MDM, whereas R306 in spleen-derived Envs reduces dependence on the CXCR4 N terminus and confers the CXCR4 restricted phenotype.

As expected, CCR5 antagonists do not reduce viral load in patients harbouring CXCR4-tropic or dual/mixed tropic viruses.

Additionally, CCR5 antagonists may not reduce the HIV-1 RNA load when mixed/dual-tropic or CXCR4-using virus is present.

Treatment of the target cells with these agents did not change the levels of CD4 or CXCR4, but reduced levels of CCR5 on the cell surface.

Through the use of chimeric CXCR4/CCR5 receptors we have previously shown that CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 isolates acquire a more flexible receptor use over time, and that this links to a reduced viral susceptibility to inhibition by the CCR5 ligand RANTES.

Moreover, the lasting predominating CCR5-tropism during periods of full viral control suggests the involvement of cellular mechanisms that preferentially reduce CXCR4-tropic viruses during cART.

We also found that mutations at C-terminus of CCR5 reduced its ability to form heterodimers with CXCR4.

DT-13 significantly decreased the gene expression of CCR5 in both BGC-823 and HGC-27 gastric cancer cells, and moderately reduced the expression of CXCR4.

After 3 days CCR5 expression was reduced both in CD4+ and in CD8+ T lymphocytes, while CXCR4 expression was not, coincident with initiation of HIV replication in culture.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from CCR2-V64I heterozygotes had normal levels of CCR2b and CCR5 but slightly reduced levels of CXCR4.

The use of CCR5 inhibitors as a second-line treatment increases the possibility that these reagents will select for more pathogenic CXCR4-using variants.

CXCR4 expression on lymphocytes from septic patients was increased whereas CCR5 was decreased and CCR7 was unchanged.

Drugs of abuse may promote HIV replication by increasing the expression of CCR5 receptors, decreasing the expression of CCR5 receptor ligands increasing the expression of CXCR4 receptors, increasing the expression of DC-SIGN, and possibly inducing epigenetic changes.

Our results showed that IL-1 increased CXCR4 expression whereas TNF-alpha increased CX3CR1, CCR9 and CCR5.

In fact, we found that CXCR4 remained high in monocyte-macrophage cells throughout infection and its expression was increased in T-lymphocytes in Group II patients as opposed to CCR5 behavior in BALf which significantly decreases.

However, after 3 months of combined anti-retroviral regimen, expression of CXCR4 significantly increased while CCR5 decreased when compared with pretherapy determinations.

We hypothesized: (i) that the early dominance of CCR5-tropic viruses results from faster turnover rates of CCR5(+) cells, and (ii) that X4-tropic strains exert greater pathogenicity by preferentially increasing turnover rates within the CXCR4(+) compartment.

Sequence comparisons indicate that X4 virus can be selected in vivo due to either absence of CCR5 receptors or relative increase of CXCR4 receptors.

Some degree of resistance with continued CCR5 use is possible if viruses develop an increased affinity for unbound CCR5 molecules, characterized phenotypically by a classic shift in the 50 % inhibitory concentration.

Recently, CCR5 antagonists have been developed that obstruct binding of CCR5 by gp120, thus inhibiting host cell entry.

CCR5 is also the principal co-receptor for macrophage-tropic strains of human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1), and efforts have been made to develop ligands to inhibit HIV-1 infection by promoting CCR5 receptor endocytosis.

IMPORTANCE It is believed that each CCR5 antagonist-resistant isolate will develop its own unique set of mutations, making it difficult to identify a signature mutation that can effectively predict CCR5 antagonist resistance.

In this review we first describe the advantages and limitations of the currently available strategies for HIV prevention, then we focus on strategies targeting CCR5, covering the progress that has been made in developing different classes of CCR5 inhibitors for prophylaxis, and the perspectives for their future development as new weapons in the global fight against HIV/AIDS.

Recent studies have shown additional unique features of certain CCR5 inhibitors such as immunomodulating properties and HIV-1 latency reversal properties, and thus, continuous efforts in developing new CCR5 inhibitors with unique binding profiles is necessary.

Approximately 70 % to 85 % of wild-type and CCR5+/- mice infected with PbA developed CM, whereas only about 20 % of PbA-infected CCR5-deficient mice exhibited the characteristic neurologic signs of CM.

Moreover, experiments using bone marrow (BM)-chimeric mice showed that a reduced but significant proportion of deficient mice grafted with CCR5+ BM develop CM, indicating that CCR5 expression on a radiation-resistant brain cell population is necessary for CM to occur.

CCR5 developed high-titer anti-CCR5 antibody responses.

However, exacerbated arthritis was not intrinsic to the CCR5(-/-) lymphoid cells, because the arthritis that developed in SCID mouse recipients was similar to that in WT and CCR5(-/-) mice.

In order to study the distribution of CCR5, we developed a series of monoclonal antibodies against human CCR5.

To understand the molecular basis of the binding of chemokines and HIV-1 to CCR5, we developed a number of mAbs that inhibit the various interactions of CCR5, and mapped the binding sites of these mAbs using a panel of CCR5/CCR2b chimeras.

These findings suggest that CCR5(-/-) mice developed less cartilage degeneration, which may indicate a potential protective role of CCR5-ablation in cartilage homeostasis.

The CCR5 antagonists maraviroc or vicriviroc developed to block CCR5 HIV coreceptor function, reduced in vitro invasion of basal breast cancer cells without affecting cell proliferation or viability, and maraviroc decreased pulmonary metastasis in a preclinical mouse model of breast cancer.

Through NMR and SPR experiments, we show a 19-residue TYSN-containing peptide to be a functional, hydrolytically stable CCR5 Nt isostere that was in turn used to develop both SPR-based and ELISA assays to screen for inhibitors of CCR5 binding to gp120-CD4.

Understanding transmission and control of HIV-1 in persons homozygous for CCR5(Δ32) is important given efforts to develop HIV-1 curative therapies aimed at modifying or disrupting CCR5 expression.

The viral resistance of marketed antiviral drugs including the emergence of new viral resistance of the only marketed CCR5 entry inhibitor, maraviroc, makes it necessary to develop new CCR5 allosteric inhibitors.

Our results show that efficient CCR5-mediated MDM entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses is associated with increased tolerance of several mutations within the CCR5 N terminus.

We found an abrupt decline in the ability of viruses to use CCR5 for entry at this time, manifested by a 1-to 2-log increase in susceptibility to CCR5 inhibitors and a reduced ability to infect cell lines with low CCR5 expression.

CCL3 transport occurred independently of the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, albeit that migrated cells displayed increased expression of CCR1 and CCR5.

The CCL5 activation of PC cells expressing CCR5 increased their invasive potential, while treatment with CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc inhibited the CCL5 activation.

In this context, the C-C chemokine ligand 5/C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCL5/CCR5) axis is gained increasing attention, since abnormal expression and activity of CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 have been found in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

In this context, the C-C chemokine ligand 5/C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCL5/CCR5) axis is gaining increasing attention, since abnormal expression and activity of CCL5 and its receptor CCR5 have been found in hematological malignancies and solid tumors.

The validation experiments showed that those variants in CCR5 and C3AR1 significantly increased the rise of intracellular calcium and the variant in CCR5 profoundly enhanced proliferative capacity of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells.

The gene expression levels of neurotrophic factors such as nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and Artemin and C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) were augmented by inflammatory cytokines, while chemokines increased only CCR5 gene expression.

Both CCR5 and CCR2 expression were increased in AD patients respect to control subjects and the expression of CCR2 and CCR5 was more frequent on CD4+ and less frequent on CD8+ cells.

CCR5(-/-) (H-2(b)) recipients of A/J (H-2(a)) cardiac allografts had equivalent numbers of donor-reactive CD4 T cells producing IFN-gamma, whereas CD4 T cells producing IL-4 were increased in CCR5(-/-) recipients.

It is concluded that the knock-out of CCR5 on donor cells results in increase of GVHD and donor CD8(+) T cell expansion, as well as hepatic and renal lesions in allo-HSCT, which indicates that CCR5 is very important in allo-BMT.

Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from WNV-infected CCR5+/+ mice into infected CCR5-/- mice increased leukocyte accumulation in the CNS compared with transfer of splenocytes from infected CCR5-/- mice into infected CCR5-/- mice, and increased survival to 60 %, the same as in infected CCR5+/+ control mice.

The increased prevalence of CCR5-Delta32 homozygosity associated with increased viral loads in patients with chronic hepatitis C suggests that the CCR5-Delta32 mutation may be an adverse host factor in hepatitis C.

Significant differences in relative content of Th and CTL carrying CCR5 and CCR6 were not detected despite a non-significant increase of quantity of CCR5+ and CCR6+ Th.

Expression of Th1-associated CCR5 was down-regulated following antigen challenge, together with an increased CCR4/CCR5 ratio and CCL2 secretion in GAD-alum-treated patients, but not in the placebo group.

CCR5(-/-) mice showed reduced tumor volume, tumor weight, and increased survival rate when compared to CCR5(+/+) mice.

Here, we studied the mechanisms of CCR5 upregulation and increased immunosuppressive function of CCR5+ MDSC.

CCR5 ligand, gene and protein expression of CCR5, and surface expression of CCR5 significantly increased in blood and tumor of tumor-bearing mice, suggesting MDSC may be attracted into the parenchyma by CCL5/CCR5.

Instead, adoptive transfer of CCR5(+) CD4(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs into Ccr5(-/-) mice resulted in increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and TGF-β) in the spleen and brain, and transferred CCR5(+) Tregs were found to produce IL-10.

Furthermore, CCR5 blockade promoted PPARγ activation, and the increased numbers of M2 macrophages induced by CCR5 blockade were both reversed with additional PPARγ antagonist treatment.

An elevated intestinal CCL3 expression 1 week after allo-BMT was associated with an increased expression of CCR5 but not CCR1 or CCR3, and in the lung and liver CCL3-CCL5 expression was associated with increases in CCR1 and CCR5.

In addition, we provided evidence that upregulation of SOD-1 by CCL5/CCR5 activation occurred in parallel with the increased release of tumour necrosis factor-alpha and nitric oxide and production of intracellular reactive oxygen species as well as enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB transcriptional activity in CCR5-positive RAW264.

CCR1 blockade in CCR5(-/-) mice significantly reduced renal chemokine expression, T cell infiltration, and glomerular crescent formation, indicating that increased renal leukocyte recruitment and consecutive tissue damage in nephritic CCR5(-/-) mice depended on functional CCR1.

CCR5 expression at different time points of infection revealed increased expression at protein and mRNA level from 3 to 24 h and beyond 24 h expression of CCR5 is downregulated.

In CCR5 knockout (KO) mice, these CS-induced increases in CCR5 ligands, inflammatory cells in BAL and peribronchial lymphoid follicles were all significantly attenuated compared with wild-type animals.

However, CCR5 deficiency did not affect CS-induced airway wall remodelling, because chronic CS exposure induced a similar increase in airway wall thickness, smooth muscle mass and peribronchial deposition of collagen and fibronectin in both wild-type and CCR5 KO mice.

We show that in contrast to their wild-type (WT) counterparts, CCR5-/- CD4+CD25+ nTreg cells resulted in an increased magnitude of parasite-specific, interferon gamma-producing CD4+ T cells within infection sites, dramatically reduced parasite numbers, and potent resistance to infection, a finding consistent with the clinical outcome of infected CCR5-/- mice.

In conclusion, lack of the chemokine receptor CCR5 exacerbates experimental cerulein-induced AP and leads to increased levels of CC chemokines and a more pronounced pancreatic inflammatory infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of AP.

Serum levels of CCR5 ligands and their hepatic transcript levels were significantly increased after Con A injection, whereas CCR5+ liver mononuclear cells were recruited to the liver.

In conclusion, CCR5 deficiency exacerbates T-cell-mediated hepatitis, and leads to increased levels of CCR5 ligands and a more pronounced liver mononuclear infiltrate, suggesting that CCR5 expression can modulate severity of immuno-mediated liver injury.

An array of 23 H/M-CCR5 hybrids containing increasing amounts of H-CCR5 extending from the N terminus generated by random chimeragenesis had a biphasic pattern of coreceptor activity with JRFL and 89.6, revealing active regions in the N-terminal extracellular domain (N-ED) and at the junction of cytoplasmic loop 3.

In addition, CCR5-deficient mice had an enhanced delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction and increased humoral responses to T cell-dependent antigenic challenge, indicating a novel role of CCR5 in down-modulating T cell-dependent immune response.

This mAb was a genuine antagonist of CCR5, since it failed to stimulate an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in the CCR5 transfectants, but blocked calcium responses elicited by RANTES, MIP-1alpha, or MIP-1beta.

Surprisingly, CCR5 restoration in the BM alone was not sufficient to rescue the wild type phenotype, suggesting that impaired tumor growth associated with inhibiting CCL5/CCR5 is not due to defects in EPC biology.

Furthermore, AMD3100 and maraviroc, antagonists of CCR5 and CXCR4 chemokine receptors, respectively inhibit the effect of gp120Bal on NR1, suggesting that CXCR4 and CCR5 activation are involved.

A tyrosine-sulfated CCR5-mimetic peptide, CCR5mim1 inhibits HIV-1 infection more efficiently than sulfopeptides based on the CCR5 amino terminus.

Using a panel of synthetic CCR5 ECL2-derived peptides, we show that the C-terminal portion of ECL2 (2 C, comprising amino acids Cys-178 to Lys-191) inhibit HIV-1 entry of both CCR5- and CXCR4-using isolates at low micromolar concentrations.

A monoclonal CCR5 antibody, PRO 140 (a humanised form of the PA14 antibody)  inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1.

Despite no detection of surface CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4 by flow cytometry, AD8 infection of AD38 cells was inhibited by maraviroc and NL4-3 was inhibited by AMD3100, demonstrating that HIV enters AD38 hepatic cell lines via CCR5 or CXCR4.

Thereby, the 30-oxo-calenduladiol-associated anti-HIV-1 activity against R5-tropic virus appears to rely on the selective occupancy of the CCR5 receptor to inhibit CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection.

The chemokine receptor CCR5 provides an entry portal for HIV-1, and PRO 140 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to CCR5 and potently inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) HIV-1 in vitro.

CCR5 receptors on HL cell lines were functionally active, since neutralizing anti-CCL5 monoclonal antibodies inhibited basal proliferation of HL-derived cell lines and recombinant CCR5 ligands (CCL3/Mip-1 alpha, CCL4/Mip1 beta and CCL5/Rantes) increased their clonogenic growth.

The CCR5 co-receptor antagonists inhibit fusion of HIV with the host cell by blocking the interaction between the gp-120 viral glycoprotein and the CCR5 chemokine receptor.

PRO 140 is a humanized mAb that binds to the CCR5 coreceptor and inhibits CCR5-tropic HIV-1 by interfering with viral entry.

PRO 140 (a humanized form of the PA14 antibody, a monoclonal CCR5 antibody) inhibits CCR5-tropic (R5) type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (MVC) inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry by altering the CCR5 extracellular loops (ECL), such that the gp120 envelope glycoproteins (Env) no longer recognize CCR5.

More in depth in vitro studies have shown that editing the CCR5 locus was able to inhibit infection from CCR5-utilizing virus, but CXCR4-utilizing virus was still able to infect cells.

Entry inhibitors, such as Maraviroc, bind to CCR5 inhibiting entry of CCR5 utilizing viruses (R5 viruses).

With regard to the latter, peptides derived from the HIV coreceptor CCR5 were previously shown to modestly inhibit entry of CCR5-tropic HIV strains, with a peptide containing residues 178-191 of the second extracellular loop (peptide 2 C) showing the strongest inhibition.

Finally, when CCR5 genetic polymorphism data were integrated with results from the in vitro LC infection studies, PSC-RANTES was found to be equally effective in inhibiting R5 HIV in LC isolated from individuals with CCR5 diplotypes known to be associated with low, intermediate, and high cell surface levels of CCR5.

Here, we demonstrate that a tyrosine sulfated peptide, reproducing the entire N-terminal extracellular region of CCR5, its unsulfated analogue, and a point-mutated peptide are unable to inhibit R5-HIV-1 mediated infection, competing with the entire CCR5 in the formation of gp120-CD4-CCR5 complex.

We propose that the binding of small molecules to the transmembrane domain of CCR5 may disrupt the conformation of its extracellular domain, thereby inhibiting ligand binding to CCR5.

In conclusion, interference with CCR5 may efficiently inhibit the replication of at least some dualtropic HIV-1 strains, whereas forced CXCR4 usage may result in viral escape from CCR5-dependent inhibitory effects.

Here we demonstrate that a tyrosine-sulfated peptide based on the N terminus of CCR5, but not its unsulfated analogue inhibits infection of macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells by CCR5-dependent, but not CXCR4-dependent, HIV-1 isolates.

However, CD4+ mature thymocytes were productively infected with the CCR5-tropic strain Ba-L, and this infection was specifically inhibited with the CCR5 agonist, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta.

The entry of SIVmac239, which uses the same coreceptors (CD4/CCR5) as HIV-1, was not inhibited by FP-21399, indicating that the antiviral effect of FP-21399 is specific for the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and is not dependent upon the cellular receptors CD4 and CCR5.

The C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) antagonist, maraviroc, concentration-dependently inhibited gp120-induced tumour necrosis factor-α gene expression, indicating that these effects occurred via gp120 activation of CCR5.

Quantitative microscopy of 2 G12 binding and dissociation from single virions and studies using a split CCR5 coreceptor suggest that 2 G12 competitively inhibits interactions between gp120\s V3 loop and the tyrosine sulfate-containing CCR5 amino terminus, thereby reducing assembly of complexes that catalyze entry.

DAPTA, a HIV gp120-derived CCR5 entry inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit CCR5-mediated monocyte migration and to attenuate neuroinflammation.

The BSCI termed Peptide 3 strongly inhibited CCR5 mediated HIV infection of THP-1 cells (83 +/- 7 % inhibition assayed by immunofluoresence staining), but had no effect on gp120 binding to CCR5.

All CCR5 models had equally good geometry, but that built from the recently reported dimeric structure of the other HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4 bound to the peptide CVX15 (Protein Data Bank code 3 OE0) best agreed with the SDM data and discriminated CCR5 from non-CCR5 binders in a virtual screening approach.

SDM and automated docking predicted that maraviroc inserts deeply in CCR5 transmembrane cavity where it can occupy three different binding sites, whereas CCL3 and gp120 lie on distinct yet overlapped regions of the CCR5 extracellular loop 2.

While the lack of structural information on CCR5 has hampered the rational design of specific inhibitors, mimetics of the chemokines that naturally bind CCR5 can be molecularly engineered.

Compound 14 (2-isobutyl-N-({[N-methyl-N-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl) amino]methyl}phenyl)-1-oxo-23-dihydro-1H-2-benzazepine-4-carboxamide) activates the CCR5 receptor in a CCL4-dependent manner, but does not compete with [ 3 H]TAK-779 binding at the CCR5.

The small molecule metal ion chelators bipyridine and terpyridine complexed with Zn2+ (ZnBip and ZnTerp) act as CCR5 agonists and strong positive allosteric modulators of CCL3 binding to CCR5, weak modulators of CCL4 binding, and competitors for CCL5 binding.

We describe the use of two CCR5 antagonists, Schering-C (SCH-C), which is specific for CCR5, and TAK-779, a dual inhibitor of CCR5 and CCR2b, to probe the CCR5 inhibitor binding site using CCR5/CCR2b chimeric receptors.

Here, we present a 2.9 Å resolution crystal structure of CCR5 bound to PF-232798, a second-generation oral CCR5 antagonist currently in phase II clinical trials.

CCL4, a CC chemokine, previously known as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 β, has diverse effects on various types of immune and nonimmune cells by the virtue of its interaction with its specific receptor, CCR5, in collaboration with related but distinct CC chemokines such as CCL3 and CCL5, which can also bind CCR5.

For example, compounds that prevent CD4 or CCR5 binding have been demonstrated recently to prevent vaginal transmission in rhesus macaques, but the expression and distribution of CCR5 has not been examined in the macaque vagina.

With the use of a series of complementary techniques to measure CCR5 expression (antibody labeling, Western blot, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction), we established that intracellular pools of CCR5 do not exist and that the results obtained by the other researchers were false-positives that arose because of the generation of irrelevant binding sites for anti-CCR5 antibodies during fixation and permeabilization of cells.

CCR5 antagonists block HIV cell entry through competitive binding to the CCR5 receptor present on the surface of CD4(+) cells.

Here, we show that rhesus cDDR5 (rcDDR5)-specific antibodies react with not only cell-expressed but also virion-incorporated simian CCR5s (siCCR5s), but may predominantly exert their inhibitory effects on simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection by the binding of cell-expressed rather than virion-incorporated CCR5s.

These results suggest that the virion-incorporated CCR5 may contribute to the reactivation of the anti-rcDDR5 antibody-producing B-cells by SIV particles after rcDDR5 immunization, although the binding of anti-rcDDR5 antibody to virion-incorporated CCR5 results in a partial inhibitory effect on SIV infection.

A panel of synthetic peptides spanning the CCR5-ECL1 region and displaying glycine or alanine substitutions was assayed for antibody binding with a pool of natural anti-CCR5 antibodies.

In molecular docking studies of YM-370749 and a three-dimensional model of CCR5 based on the rhodopsin crystal structure as well as binding and functional studies using various CCR5 mutants, the amino acid residues necessary for interaction with YM-370749 were marked.

Epidermal but not intramuscular delivery of the CCR5 gene to mice elicited strong IgG antibody binding responses to CCR5.

Thus reactivity of antibodies raised to CCR5 against phage-displayed peptides defined mimotopes that reflect binding sites for these antibodies and reveal a part of the gp120 binding sites on CCR5.

The 2 D7 binding site mapped to the second extracellular loop of CCR5, whereas a group of mAbs that failed to block chemokine binding all mapped to the NH2-terminal region of CCR5.

To further understand how different envelope molecules use CCR5 as an entry cofactor, we show that soluble purified envelope glycoproteins (SU component) from CCR5-tropic HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV can compete for binding of iodinated chemokine to CCR5.

Soluble CD4 was found to potentiate binding of the HIV-2 ST and SIVmac239 envelope glycoproteins to CCR5, suggesting that a CD4-induced conformational change in SU is required for subsequent binding to CCR5.

Initial studies in mice identified a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal domain of pig-tailed macaque CCR5 fused to streptavidin that, when conjugated at high density to bovine papillomavirus major capsid protein L1 VLPs, induced high-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) that bound to a macaque CCR5-expressing cell line in vitro.

We previously reported that F4/80(-) B220(-) CD11c(+) DC precursors expressing the CC chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5 are mobilized rapidly into the circulation in mice injected with Propionibacterium acnes and are recruited into inflammatory tissue by macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha), which binds to CCR1 and CCR5.

Experiments involving peptide pretreatment and washing, modulation of the expression levels of Env and CCR5, analysis of CCR5 peptide effects against different coreceptors, and inhibition of radiolabeled glycoprotein (gp) 120 binding to CCR5 suggested that the peptide-blocking activities reflect their interactions with gp120.

We show in this study that a 30-aa-based CCR5-Ig fusion protein encoding the second extracellular domain of receptor selectively binds and neutralizes all three CCR5 ligands and, when administered during ongoing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rapidly suppressed the disease while arresting Ag-specific effector T cell functions.

These vaccines induce anti-CCR5 antibodies that bind to native CCR5 and inhibit SIV infection in vitro.

Targeting CCR5/CCR5 ligand signaling via a fusion protein mCCR5-Ig, which selectively binds and neutralizes all three CCR5 ligands, increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice.

Using binding assays, we further determined that recombinant CCR5-T4L and [ 125 I]-CCL5 compete for the same binding site on wild type CCR5.

Expression of UL33 and UL78 had pleiotropic, predominantly negative, effects on CCR5 and CXCR4 cell surface expression, ligand-induced internalization, signal transduction, and migration without modifying the chemokine binding properties of CCR5 and CXCR4.

As the CCR5 N terminus-gp120 interactions are dependent on CD4 activation, our data suggest that gp120 has separate binding sites for the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2, the ECL2 binding site is present prior to CD4 engagement, and it is conserved across CCR5- and CXCR4-using strains.

Maraviroc (MVC) and other CCR5 antagonists are HIV-1 entry inhibitors that bind to- and alter the conformation of CCR5, such that CCR5 is no longer recognized by the viral gp120 envelope (Env) glycoproteins.

CCR5 binding and HIV-1 infection inhibition experiments suggest that the two CCR5 inhibitor-resistant viruses altered their interactions with CCR5 in different ways.

TAK779 and maraviroc (MVC), inhibit CCL3 and the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 binding to CCR5 by a noncompetitive and allosteric mechanism, supporting the view that they bind to regions of CCR5 distinct from the gp120- and CCL3-binding sites.

Dissociation of [ (125) I]CCL3 from CCR5 was accelerated by TAK779, to a lesser extent by MVC, and by GTP analogs, suggesting that inverse agonism contributes to allosteric inhibition of the chemokine binding to CCR5.

This suggests that allosteric CCR5 inhibitors not only act by blocking gp120 binding but also alter distinct steps of CCR5 usage in the course of HIV infection.

CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5, one of the second receptors of HIV-1, and inhibit HIV-1 entry into CD4+ cells.

In contrast, TA1 interacted with CCR5 less efficiently and was highly sensitive to antibodies that bind to the CCR5 N terminus and ECL2.

To present recent information on the evolution of coreceptor use from CCR5 alone to CCR5 and CXCR4, the impact CCR5 inhibitors have on this process, and new insights into HIV-1 binding to CD4 and CCR5.

Genetic polymorphisms in humans that affect CCR5 or chemokines that bind CCR5 affect not only virus entry but also immune reconstitution.

Maraviroc is a CCR5 co-receptor antagonist that blocks HIV binding to the CCR5 receptor, which is a CD4 co-receptor necessary for cell entry.

Recombinant gp120 proteins from two HIV-1 subtype B clones bound CCR5 in the presence of CD4, while gp120 from the X4-tropic, HxB2, clone did not bind CCR5.

The small molecule NBD-556 mimics CD4 by binding the gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein, moderately inhibiting virus entry into CD4-expressing target cells and enhancing CCR5 binding and virus entry into CCR5-expressing cells lacking CD4.

The results obtained for CCR5 suggest the possibility that different active scaffolds bind in different ways within the CCR5 pocket.

CCR5 antagonists bind to CCR5 to prevent viral entry.

HIV resistance to CCR5 antagonists occurs either through outgrowth of pre-existing CXCR4-using viruses, or through acquisition of the ability of CCR5-using HIV-1 to use the antagonist bound form of CCR5.

In addition, CCR5 binding by FLSC IgG1, but not CCR5 Ab 2 D7, was significantly increased when cells were treated with MVC, suggesting MVC allosterically increases exposure of the FLSC IgG1 binding site.

The cell surface receptors CD4 and CCR5 bind CCR5-tropic HIV Envelope (Env) glycoprotein during virus attachment.

However, we showed here that different CCR5 conformations at the cell surface are differentially engaged by chemokines and gp120, making chemokines weaker inhibitors of HIV infection than would be expected from their binding affinity constants for CCR5.

Whereas native CCR5 chemokines bind with subnanomolar affinity to (NF) G protein-coupled CCR5, gp120/HIV-1 does not discriminate between (NF) G protein-coupled and uncoupled CCR5.

Abolishing CCR5 interaction with (NF) G proteins eliminates high-affinity binding of CCR5 chemokines but preserves receptor endocytosis, indicating that chemokines preferentially endocytose low-affinity receptors.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist binds to CCR5 receptor.

From a functional standpoint, we illustrate that the nature of the CCR5 molecules to which gp120/HIV-1 binds shapes sensitivity to inhibition by CCR5 ligands and cellular tropism.

In order to evaluate if these cells are infectabile by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and could be employed as a model in HIV research we exposed these cell lines to X4 (T-cell tropic) and R5 (macrophage tropic) and subsequently tried to correlate their infectability with (i) level of chemokine coreceptor (CXCR4 and CCR5) expression, (ii) coreceptor functionality (calcium flux, chemotaxis and phosphorylation of MAPK p42/44 and AKT) and (iii) endogenous expression and secretion of HIV-related chemokines which compete with the virus for binding to CXCR4 (SDF-1/CXCL12) or CCR5 (MIP-1beta/CCL4, MIP-1alpha/CCL3, RANTES/CCL5, MCP-2/CCL8, MCP-3/CCL7 and MCP-4/CCL13).

These included derivatives of a CCR5 ligand, RANTES, with modified N-termini as well as Kaposi\s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-encoded chemokines that bind a wide range of co-receptors, including CCR5, CXCR4, CCR3 and CCR8, as well as the orphan 7 TM receptors GPR1 and STRL33.

We hypothesized that CD34(+) cells secrete CCR5-binding chemokines and that these factors interfere with HIV R5 interactions with these cells, possibly by binding CCR5 or by inducing its internalization.

Substitution of the 8 x V3 loop with that from the R5 virus strain BaL resulted in an Env (8 x-V3BaL) that mediated CD4-independent CCR5-dependent virus infection and a gp120 that bound to CCR5 in the absence of CD4.

The best juice was tested for inhibition of: (1) infection by HIV-1 BaL, utilizing CCR5 as the cellular coreceptor, and (2) binding of gp120 IIIB and gp120 BaL, respectively, to CXCR4 and CCR5.

We predicted the structural basis for pleiotropic signaling of the C-C chemokine type 5 (CCR5) G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) by predicting the binding of several ligands to the lower-energy conformations of the CCR5 receptor and 11 mutants.

Maraviroc, a CCR5 antagonist blocking coreceptor binding during HIV entry, is active in vitro against CCR5-tropic HIV-2 but more studies are needed to validate its use in therapeutic treatments against HIV-2 infection.

MVC significantly reduced macrophage inflammatory protein 1 β-induced CCR5 internalization in rectal mononuclear cells, an indication of efficient binding to CCR5 in rectal lymphocytes.

Unlike human CCR5 chemokine ligands which induce rapid CCR5 internalization mediated via clathrin, treatment with U83A prevents internalization.

Indeed, the CCR5 agonists described herein were found to induce profound down-modulation of CCR5 (and not CXC chemokine receptor 4) from the cell surface and its sustained sequestration in the intracellular compartment without inducing chemotaxis in vitro.

Here we discovered that, in T cells, natural CCR5 antibodies induce a CCR5-negative phenotype with the involvement of β-arrestin2, which leads to the formation of a stable CCR5 signalosome with both β-arrestin2 and ERK1.

We show that macaque-specific CCR5 ZFNs efficiently induce CCR5 disruption at levels of up to 64 % ex vivo, 40 % in vivo early posttransplant, and 3 % to 5 % in long-term repopulating cells over 6 months following HSPC transplant.

In loco cell analysis demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of B-1 CCR5(+/+) lymphocytes to CCR5 deficient host was associated with a more intense influx of T CD8(+) to tumor site, indicating that the presence of CCR5(+/+) B-1 cells in the tumor environment induces the migration of T CD8 CCR5(-/-) cells to the implantation site.

These " helper" NK cells potently attract iDCs in a CCR5-dependent mechanism and induce high DC production of CXCR3 and CCR5 ligands (CXCL9, CXCL10, and CCL5), facilitating the subsequent recruitment of type-1 effector CD8(+) T (Teff) cells.

CCR5 blockade also induces suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) upregulations, and anti-CCR5 antibody fails to suppress expression of phospho-Stat3 (p-Stat3), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and IL-6 in cells transfected with SOCS3 short-interfering RNA (SiRNA).

Investigation of mechanism(s) of the CD56+ T cell action on HIV-1 showed that although CD56+ T SN had little effect on HIV-1 entry coreceptor CCR5 expression, CD56+ T SN induced the expression of CC-chemokines, the ligands for CCR5.

Of note, some of these medications such as arsenic trioxide and Jak inhibitors may also reversibly down regulate CCR5 expression on CD4+ T-cells, thus escaping the ethical issues of inducing or transferring mutations in CCR5 that are presently the subject of interest as it relates to HIV-1 cure strategies.

The virus-like particle (VLP)-CCR5 composition aims to function as either a preventative and/or therapeutic vaccine inducing durable autoantibodies that can block CCR5 and prevent HIV entry or attenuate disease progression.

To investigate the functional role of CCR5 in renal inflammation, we induced a T cell-dependent model of glomerulonephritis (nephrotoxic serum nephritis) in CCR5(-/-) mice.

The fact that CCR5+ regulatory T cells preferentially accumulate in the gravid uterus and that expression of CCR5 on regulatory T cells can be induced by activation lead us to propose that CCR5 is responsible for the accumulation of those regulatory T cells that have been activated by paternal antigens.

The selective CCR5 ligand CC chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4)/macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 beta induced the chemotaxis of thymocytes that had been derived from the transgenic mice, but not from littermate mice, suggesting that the human CCR5 expressed in the transgenic mice were functional.

The consecutive CCR5 gene and CCR5 peptide immunizations induced B- and T-cell responses to peptides representing both human and macaque amino acid sequences of the respective CCR5 proteins.

To assess the role of the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR5, and a ligand for these receptors CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, in this pathogenic process, the reverse passive cutaneous Arthus reaction was induced in mice lacking CCR1, CCR5, or CCL3.

To explore the role of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the inflammatory process of EAN, we induced EAN in CCR5-deficient (CCR5(-/-)) mice with P0 protein peptide 180-199.

Initial studies in mice identified a polypeptide comprising the N-terminal domain of pig-tailed macaque CCR5 fused to streptavidin that, when conjugated at high density to bovine papillomavirus major capsid protein L1 VLPs induced high-titer immunoglobulin G (IgG) that bound to a macaque CCR5-expressing cell line in vitro.

In macaques, CCR5 peptide-conjugated VLP preparations induced high-avidity anti-CCR5 IgG autoantibody responses, and all five immunized macaques generated IgG that could block infection of CCR5-tropic simian/human immunodeficiency virus SHIV(SF162P3) in vitro.

CCR5 ligands induced cell death in these cells, but not in control neuroblastoma cells or in CCR5-expressing fibroblasts.

Our preceding study demonstrated that a nonpeptide synthetic CCR5 antagonist, TAK-779 (N, N-dimethyl-N-[4-[[[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6, 7-dihydro-5H-benzocyclohepten-8-yl]carbon-yl]amino]benzyl]-tetrahydro-2H-pyran4-aminium chloride, inhibits the development of experimentally induced arthritis by modulating the migration of CCR5(+)/CXCR3(+) T cells to joints.

The intraplantar injection of CCL5 (0.5 ng) to naïve mice evoked thermal hyperalgesia prevented by the coadministration of J113863 or the CCR5 antagonist, d-Ala-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), demonstrating that CCL5 can induce thermal hyperalgesia in mice through the activation of CCR1 or CCR5.

In order to examine effects of CCR5 on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1236-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration, we employed CCR5 wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mice.

To evaluate the role of CCR5 in hypertensive renal and cardiac end-organ damage, we induced hypertension with desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II) in wild-type (WT) and CCR5-deficient mice.

First, we show redundancy between CCR5 ligands not only in chemoattractive properties but also in their ability to induced cosignals via CCR5.

Finally, our results clearly show that although CCR5 ligands induced cosignaling for IL-2 production is directed by CCR5, other proinflammatory properties of these ligands, such as TNF-alpha, IL-17, and IFN-gamma production, are CCR5 independent and therefore likely to be mediated by the other receptors for these ligands.

These suggested that CCR2 and CCR5 mediated hepatotoxicity induced by diclofenac, TNF-α was responsible, at least in part, for it, and the pharmacological inhibition of CCR2 or CCR5 might serve as a novel therapeutic approach for DIC-induced hepatotoxicity.

Upregulation of CCR5 expression on CD11b+Gr1+ myeloid cells was induced in vitro by CCR5 ligands and other inflammatory factors.

In vitro experiments showed that the upregulation of CCR5 expression on CD11b+Gr1+ immature myeloid cells was induced by CCR5 ligands, IL-6, GM-CSF, and other inflammatory factors.

c-Met signals facilitated T cell recruitment to the heart via the chemokine receptor CCR5 by inducing autocrine CCR5 ligand release.

Homozygosity for CCR5Δ32 confers profound resistance against HIV infection, and heterozygous mutation that induces a decrease in CCR5 surface expression is associated with lower plasma viral load and delayed progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).

These data indicate that HIV infection of cells with limiting levels of cell surface CCR5 can be facilitated by gp41 sequences that are not exposed on the envelope ectodomain yet induce allosteric changes in gp120 that facilitate exposure of the CCR5 binding site.

Natural human Abs, recognizing an epitope within the first extramembrane loop of CCR5 (the main HIV coreceptor)  induce a long-lasting internalization (48 h) of the protein, whereas all known CCR5 modulating molecules show a short-term kinetics (60-90 min).

Furthermore, sorting CEM populations expressing low, intermediate, and high densities of CCR5 molecules but constant amount of CD4, we found that the capacity to induce T cell death depends at least in part on the level of CCR5 when low amount of virus was used to infect the CEM cells.

ZFNCCR5Δ32 effectively recognized the CCR5Δ32 region inducing a frameshift of the CCR5 coding region that resulted in the complete absence of CCR5 expression of mRNA and of protein at the cell surface.

We investigated the effect of potent anti-HIV ligands of CCR5 with different pharmacological profiles on arrestin2 cluster formation and found that only the ligands capable of inducing CCR5 internalization induced arrestin2 recruitment and clustering.

Treatment with anti-CCR5 antibody induces changes in the tissue distribution of CCR5+ and CD25+ T cells that may impact on the overall levels of immune activation during HIV and SIV infection.

The presence of CXCR4-using viruses in a subset of newly infected individuals could impact the efficacies of vaccine and microbicide strategies that target CCR5-tropic viruses.

We recently reported that, because these SHIVs exclusively use the CXCR4 coreceptor for cell entry, they target naive CD4(+) T cells for depletion in infected monkeys, whereas SIVs, which use CCR5, not CXCR4, cause the selective loss of memory CD4(+) T lymphocytes in vivo.

Sensitivity to neutralizing antibody was more variable, although infection of CXCR4-expressing targets was generally more sensitive to neutralization by both b12-IgG and 40000000000.0 than infection of CCR5-expressing target cells.

Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of normal lymphocytes increased CXCR4 expression but decreased CCR5 and did not change CCR7 expression.

In PMA-stimulated cells, Tat increased CXCR4 and decreased in CCR5 expression, this was potentiated in cells chronically exposed to Tat.

Chemokine receptors were also modulated in Candida-DCs, which showed increased CCR7/CXCR4 and decreased CCR5 expression.

HIVE cases had increased neuronal CXCR4 and decreased neuronal CCR5 expression as well as increased numbers of hippocampal GFAP-positive astrocytes and LN3-positive microglia.

Drugs of abuse may promote HIV replication by increasing the expression of CCR5 receptors decreasing the expression of CCR5 receptor ligands, increasing the expression of CXCR4 receptors, increasing the expression of DC-SIGN, and possibly inducing epigenetic changes.

Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes.

HAART increases CCR5 expression further and decreases CXCR4 expression, reversing the switch from CCR5 to CXCR4, which was significant for CD4 + T.

Longer survival in HIV-positive individuals is associated with high serum concentrations of ligands for CCR5 (RANTES [ regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted] and macrophage inflammatory proteins [ MIP] 1 alpha and 1 beta) and CXCR4 (stromal-derived factor [ SDF-1]), and with decreased expression of CCR5 on lymphocytes.

Upregulation of CCR4 and CCR5 expression but no decrease in CXCR4 expression on CD4+ T cells were obtained in peripheral blood from African adults with progression of the disease.

Compared to the low-risk group, the binge group showed higher CCR5 expression on PMNs, decreases in the CD69 percentage and positive PMNs per microliter, and decreased CXCR4 expression on monocytes.

IL-2 activation of CD4+ T cells from both cord and adult bloods caused a substantial increase in CCR5 expression, but moderately decreased CXCR4 expression.

During the secretory phase of the cycle when both oestradiol and progesterone are elevated, CD4 and CCR5 expression decreased whereas CXCR4 expression remained elevated.

It differentially regulates the two major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increasing CXCR4 and decreasing CCR5 expression in primary CD4(+) T-lymphocytes.

MMLV viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an R5 HIV virus specifically infect CCR5-expressing cells, and viruses pseudotyped with gp140 from an X4 HIV virus specifically infect CXCR4-expressing cells.

The sequence of V3 determines whether the virus binds to CCR5 and infects predominantly macrophages (R5 virus) or to CXCR4 and infects mostly T-cells (X4 virus).

Selection of resistant viruses and current exposure to a darunavir-based HAART tended to be more frequent in the CXCR4 group compared with the children infected with CCR5-tropic strains (P=0.

Development of CXCR4 inhibitors should greatly improve the treatment options available to patients infected with X4- and/or dual-tropic HIV-1 strains in combination with a CCR5 inhibitor.

Just over a decade after identification of chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 as coreceptors for HIV, maraviroc (Celsentri), the first CCR5 antagonist, has recently obtained its Marketing Authorization in the United States and Europe, for treatment of treatment-experienced adult patients infected with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.

We used ultradeep sequencing to investigate the evolution of the frequency of CXCR4-using viruses in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 22 patients infected with both CCR5 and CXCR4-using viruses treated with the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc for 24 weeks and a stable antiviral therapy.

This desensitization of CXCR4 and CCR5 also attenuated their capacity as the fusion cofactors for HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein and resulted in a significant inhibition of p24 production by cell lines infected with HIV-1 that use CCR5 or CXCR4 as coreceptors.

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the V3 region in proviral env gene showed that the V3 region in U87-CD4 cells infected with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates was largely different from that in the cells infected with CCR5-tropic isolates, but were highly similar to that in cells infected with dual tropic isolates.

Infection studies with HIV-1 Env-pseudotyped luciferase reporter viruses indicated that X4 Env (CXCR4-using) pseudotypes infected megakaryocytic cells, whereas R5 Env (CCR5-using) pseudotypes did not.

Macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) HIV-1 strains utilize the chemokine receptor CCR5 in conjunction with CD4 to infect cells, while T-cell-tropic (T-tropic) strains generally utilize CXCR4 as a coreceptor.

Furthermore, CCR5 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(R5) infections, and CXCR4 antagonists inhibited only MMLV-gp140(X4) infections.

This article focuses on R5X4 HIV-1, the earliest CXCR4-using variants, reviewing the pattern of coreceptor use on primary CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages, the relationship between primary cell coreceptor use and the two principal approaches to coreceptor analysis (genetic prediction and indicator cell phenotyping), and the implications of primary cell coreceptor use by these strains for treatment with a new class of small molecule antagonists that inhibit CCR5-mediated entry.

The activity is confirmed by repeat testing, and identified actives are advanced to secondary screens to determine their effect on transmission of CXCR4-tropic viruses in the presence or absence of CD4 and their ability to inhibit CXCR4- and CCR5-tropic envelope-mediated cell-to-cell fusion.

In particular both pertussis toxin (PTX) and its nontoxic B-oligomeric component (PTX-B) can block the infectious process in vitro at multiple levels, by preventing the entry of CCR5-dependent (R5) HIV strains and by inhibiting both R5 and CXCR4-dependent HIVs at post-entry level(s).

Rapamycin interferes with viral entry of CCR5 (R5)-tropic HIV and with basal transcription of the HIV LTR, potently inhibiting replication of R5 HIV but not CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV in primary cells.

Finally, using the air pouch model in mice, we show that the CCR2 and CCR5 antagonist TAK-779 inhibits cell recruitment promoted by the CXCR4 agonist SDF-1 alpha, demonstrating that cross-inhibition by antagonists also occurs in vivo.

In contrast to CXCR4 antagonists and SDF-1, viral monocyte inflammatory protein (vMIP) II inhibited not only anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (MAb) but also inhibited anti-CCR5 MAb binding to human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and inhibited both X4 and R5 HIV-1 strains.

Although both the glutathione S-transferase-CXCR4 N- and C-terminal fusion proteins were associated with the purified CyPA, truncation of the C-terminal domain of CXCR4 robustly inhibited the receptor co-immunoprecipitation with CyPA in intact cells, thereby suggesting a critical role of the receptor C terminus in this interaction.

Moreover, purified GST-conjugated CXCR4 C terminus directly associated with the purified His-tagged beta2-microglobulin (beta2M), and MHC-I heavy chain was co-immunoprecipitated with CXCR4 in a beta2M-dependent manner.

These results were confirmed in a human breast cancer xenograft mouse model, suggesting that TRAIL significantly enhanced miR-146a expression and suppressed CXCR4 expression, indicating that TRAIL-induced miR-146a up-regulation is negatively associated with CXCR4 expression.

In this review, we focus on recent advances in the characterization of dysfunctions of the CXCL12 (SDF-1)/CXCR4 signaling axis in two rare human immunodeficiencies, one associated with a loss of CXCR4 function, the Idiopathic CD4(+) T-cell Lymphocytopenia, and the other with a gain of CXCR4 function, the WHIM syndrome.

Surprisingly, primary envelopes with CXCR4 tropism mediated fusion to immature MDDCs with efficiencies similar to those of primary CCR5-tropic envelopes.

Although CCR3 and CCR5 are known to mediate infection of microglia by HIV-1, recent evidence indicate that CXCR4 also play important roles in HIV-induced neuronal injury, and dual-tropic isolates that use CXCR4 to infect macrophages have recently been reported.

All of the analogs inhibited T cell line-tropic strain HXB-2 (X4) and dual-tropic strain 89.6 (R5X4) HIV infections mediated by CXCR4, but had no effect on macrophage-tropic strain ADA (R5) or 89.6 HIV infections mediated by CCR5.

NSI strains of HIV-1 predominantly use the CCR5 chemokine receptor as a fusion cofactor, whereas fusion of T cell line-adapted SI isolates is mediated by another chemokine receptor, CXCR4.

CCR5-independent fusion was not mediated by CXCR4 and was CD4 dependent, while CCR5-mediated fusion was partly independent of CD4.

CCR5 and CXCR4 are the major coreceptors that mediate human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection, while most simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) isolates use CCR5.

This leads us to hypothesize that early and late CCR5-tropic viruses might be different in the ability to infect CCR5-low or-negative cells.

We ask whether posttreatment development of CCR5 coreceptor virus represents concerted evolution from middisease CXCR4 virus or reemergence of initial infecting CCR5 virus.

The CCR5(+) subset was exclusively infected by CCR5-dependent HIV-1 clones, whereas SI clones were preferentially isolated from the CXCR4(+) subset.

While all SI isolates infected CCR5-/- lymphocytes (and hence do not require CCR5 for viral entry), all NSI isolates, regardless of clade, did not infect CCR5-/- lymphocytes.

Conversely, late isolates were often more CD4-dependent in that productive infection in NP-2/CCR5 cells was in most cases weak and was revealed only after cocultivation of infected NP-2/CCR5 cells with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (CD4-independent-LOW).

In experiments with both cell-associated and solubilized CXCR4, we found that although CXCL12γ bound to CXCR4 with a higher affinity than did CXCL12α, CXCL12γ displayed reduced signaling and chemotactic activities.

These properties were caused by the specific carboxyl-terminal region of CXCL12γ, which, by interacting with CXCR4 sulfotyrosines, mediated high-affinity, but nonproductive binding to CXCR4.

Finally, and in contrast to the situation encountered for other previously characterized CXCR4 heteromers, we showed that the CXCR4-specific antagonist AMD3100 did not cross-inhibit chemerin binding in cells co-expressing ChemR23 and CXCR4, demonstrating that cross-regulation by AMD3100 depends on the nature of receptor partners with which CXCR4 is co-expressed.

This may explain, in part, how CXCR4-using viruses are able to bind to and infect a broader range of cell types than CCR5-using viruses, and why CXCR4-using viruses are associated with a more aggressive disease course.

Using the CCRF-CEM T cell line that endogenously expresses CXCR4 we have demonstrated that AMD11070 is an antagonist of SDF-1α ligand binding (IC50 = 12.5 ± 1.3 nM), inhibits SDF-1 mediated calcium flux (IC50 = 9.0 ± 2.0 nM) and SDF-1α mediated activation of the CXCR4 receptor as measured by a Eu-GTP binding assay (IC50 = 39.8 ± 2.5 nM) or a [ (35) S]-GTPγS binding assay (IC50 = 19.0 ± 4.1 nM), and inhibits SDF-1α stimulated chemotaxis (IC50 = 19.0 ± 4.0 nM).

CXCL12, the natural ligand for CXCR4, and the small-molecule CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 bound the proteoliposomes with affinities close to those associated with the binding of these molecules to cells expressing CXCR4 and CD4.

The health and disease-related biology of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor presents the challenge of finding a small molecule that can bind CXCR4 and block T-cell tropic human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) cell entry, while preserving the ability of CXCR4 to respond to its native ligand, CXCL12.

Downmodulation of CXCR4 was abolished by mutations that disrupt the constitutively strong AP-2 clathrin adaptor binding element located in the N-terminal region of the Nef molecule, suggesting that Nef accelerates CXCR4 endocytosis via an AP-2-dependent pathway.

CXCR4, the specific receptor for the chemokine SDF-1 alpha that also binds CXCR4-using HIV gp120s, affects survival of different cell types, including neurons.

Gp120s from CXCR4 (X4) and CCR5 (R5) using HIV-1 strains bound more efficiently to non-N-glycosylated than to N-glycosylated CXCR4 proteoliposomes in a CD4-dependent manner.

We analyzed the CXCR4 expression level and the dose-dependent inhibition of CXCR4 expression by AMD3100, by monitoring the binding of an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody (clone 12 G5).

The well-characterized CXCR4 antagonists, T22, T14012 (a downsized analog of T-22), and AMD3100, effectively inhibited 12 G5 binding to CXCR4-expressing cells, while HIV-1 entry inhibitors targeting CD4 and gp41 as well as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitors did not block the binding of 12 G5 to U373-MAGI-CXCR4(CEM) cells.

These gp120 proteins will be useful in dissecting determinants for CXCR4 binding and Env triggering and in evaluating pharmacologic inhibitors of the gp120-CXCR4 interaction.

We studied the binding of the HIV-1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein (gp) to CXCR4 but found that the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains bound nonspecifically to several cell lines lacking human CXCR4 expression.

CXCR4-PMPLs specifically bound the natural ligand, SDF-1alpha, and the gp120s from CXCR4-using HIV-1 strains.

Conformation-dependent anti-CXCR4 antibodies and the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 blocked HIV-1 gp120 binding to CXCR4-PMPLs.

We found that the antagonistic action of AMD3100 against CXCR4--as assessed by the inhibitory effects of the compound on stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1) binding to its receptor and on SDF-1-induced intracellular calcium signaling, and by displacement of the CXCR4-specific antibody, clone 12 G5--was greatly reduced by substitution of Asp(171) and/or Asp(262) by neutral asparagine residue(s).

Using FRET between a Texas Red-labeled SDF-1 alpha and an enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged CXCR4, we show that binding of SDF-1 alpha to cell surface HSPGs modifies neither the kinetics of occupancy nor activation in real time of CXCR4 by the chemokine.

A CD4-independent version of the X4 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) HXBc2 envelope (Env) protein, termed 8 x, mediates infection of CD4-negative, CXCR4-positive cells binds directly to CXCR4 in the absence of CD4 due to constitutive exposure of a conserved coreceptor binding site in the gp120 subunit, and is more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization.

Gp120 had ten times lower affinity for CXCR4 than CD4, implying that a substantial role for cellular CD4 may be to facilitate binding of the viral envelope to CXCR4.

Binding of gp120 to CXCR4 was neither regulated by guanine nucleotides, nor affected by divalent cations, was temperature independent and bound to a homogenous population of CXCR4, which is characteristic for an antagonist to a G-protein coupled receptor.

Recombinant SU(LAI) protein competed more efficiently with the CXCR4-specific monoclonal antibody 12 G5 for binding to CD4(2D) CXCR4 than for binding to CD4(4D) CXCR4.

Several CXCR4 mutants that were not capable of binding SDF-1 or signaling still supported HIV-1 infection, indicating that the ability of CXCR4 to function as a coreceptor is independent of its ability to signal.

Further deletion of the V1 and V2 loops restored CXCR4 binding activity, but additional removal of the V3 loop eliminated the gp120-CXCR4 interaction, without decreasing the affinity between mutated sgp120 and CD4.

A significant part of CXCR4 was targeted to lysosomes upon binding of the ligands, and recycling of internalized CXCR4 was not efficient.

Notably, our CXCR4 model and docking procedure can be applied to predict new compounds that are either inhibitors of gp120-CXCR4 binding without affecting stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha) chemotaxis activity, or inhibitors of SDF-1 alpha-CXCR4 binding resulting in an anti-metastasis effect.

However, escape from inhibition by reagents that block gp120-CD4 binding, CD4-induced CXCR4 binding and 6-helix bundle formation, respectively, indicated large difference between HIV-1 and HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins in their CD4-induced rates of engagement with CXCR4.

The AACs and APACs inhibit HIV-1 cell entry by interacting with gp120 at the CD4-binding site, by interacting with CXCR4 at the binding site of the CXCR4 mAb 12 G5, and apparently by interacting with transient structures of the ectodomain of gp41.

A CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent mechanism of viral entry is proposed, by which immature HIV particles from infected lymphocytes might directly bind to CXCR4 on astrocytes and trigger virus--cell fusion during or after the process of viral maturation.

With the use of epitope mapping, mutagenesis, and structural studies, we show that this altered mechanism is characterized by increased exposure of CD4-induced epitopes in gp120 and by a more critical interaction between BR-derived Envs and the CCR5 N-terminus, which was associated with the predicted presence of additional atomic contacts formed at the gp120-CCR5 N-terminus interface.

In this report we show that a variant of HIV-2/NIHz, termed HIV-2/vcp, previously shown to utilize CXCR4 without CD4, is also CD4 independent on rhesus (rh) CCR5, but requires CD4 to fuse with human (hu) CCR5.

Thus, CCR5 expression is required for infection with NSI isolates and the CCR5 usage is independent of viral genotype.

CCR5 antagonists are a powerful new class of antiretroviral drugs that require a companion assay to evaluate the presence of CXCR4-tropic (non-R5) viruses prior to use in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.

However, as these drugs do not inhibit HIV variants that use the CXCR4 co-receptor, a pretreatment test is required to determine accurately HIV co-receptor usage (tropism) before initiating CCR5 antagonist-based therapy.

In the course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease, CCR5-utilizing HIV type 1 (HIV-1) variants (R5), which typically transmit infection and dominate its early stages, persist in approximately half of the infected individuals (nonswitch virus patients), while in the other half (switch virus patients), viruses using CXCR4 (X4 or R5X4) emerge, leading to rapid disease progression.

Furthermore, GHOST cell infection assays and blocking experiments with the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 showed that the later D36 1999 isolate could infect both CCR5(+) and CCR5(-) CXCR4(+) cells efficiently, while infection by the 1995 isolate was nearly completely restricted to CCR5(+) cells.

These results are consistent with previous studies performed in our laboratory where PM were readily infected by CCR5-using HIV strains but could not be productively infected by HIV strains that exclusively use CXCR4 as a co-receptor.

Here we show that two in vitro-established CD4(-)/CCR5(-)/CXCR4(+) human pre-T-cell lines (A3 and A5) can be productively infected by wild-type laboratory-adapted T-cell-tropic HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains in a CD4-independent, CXCR4-dependent fashion.

Since viruses which use CXCR4 exclusively cannot infect macrophages, these data have implications for the relative infection of the T-cell compartment versus the macrophage compartment in vivo and for the development of CCR5-based therapeutics.

Interestingly, some dual-tropic primary SI strains that infected Lestr+ cells failed to infect CCR5+ cells, suggesting that these viruses may use an alternative coreceptor for infection of macrophages.

These results suggest that CXCR4-tropic viruses are present within the quasispecies of patients infected with subtype C virus and that antiretroviral treatment may create an environment for the emergence of CXCR4 tropism.

cmvIL-10 is a secreted viral cytokine that affects CXCR4 signaling in both infected and uninfected cells, while US27 is a component of the virus particle and impacts CXCR4 activity only in infected cells.

Additionally, we show that in HCMV, strain TB40E, infected HUVEC the surface expression of CXCR4 is strongly downregulated, whereas in TB40E-delUS28 infected cells, CXCR4 surface expression is not altered in particular at late time points of infection.

To address causal involvement of CXCR4 in advanced stages of atherosclerosis we reconstituted LDLr(-/-) mice with autologous bone marrow infected with lentivirus encoding SDF-1α antagonist or CXCR4 degrakine, which effects proteasomal degradation of CXCR4.

chagasi antigen LCR1 stimulates IFN-gamma production from T cells of infected BALB/c mice, and immunization with recombinant LCR1 partially protects against L.

Transfected COS7 cells that express a high level of CD4 but a low level of CXCR4 were infected significantly more efficiently by two primary CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 isolates compared to the prototypic laboratory HIV-1 isolate IIIB.

An experiment was carried out to search the expression of CXCR4 retrospectively in FIV (CrFK) infected cat brain tissues using immunohistochemically in the formalin fixed paraffin sections against 12 G5, a mouse monoclonal antibody to CXCR4.

We thus investigate CXCR4 expression in cells infected with this m7NDK CXCR4-dependent HIV-1 mutant.

CXCR4-tropic (X4) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not efficiently infect and replicate in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice reconstituted with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, termed " hu-PBL-SCID mice" due to, at least in part, relatively low levels of expression of the CXCR4 coreceptor.

Although CXCR4-tropic viruses are relatively uncommon among untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals except during advanced immunodeficiency, the prevalence of CXCR4-tropic viruses among treated patients with detectable viremia is unknown.

Immunoreactive CCR5 and CCR2B receptors were detected in human blastocysts whereas CXCR4 and CXCR1 were not present.

Strikingly, early CXCR4 signaling of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase detected by SDF-1alpha-induced AKT phosphorylation, was insensitive to RANTES-CCR5 signals.

In contrast to CXCR4, CCR5 was detected at low levels on thymocytes, and CCR5 agonists did not induce calcium flux or chemotaxis in thymocytes.

Antibody inhibition studies showed that infection by CXCR4-tropic viral strains is mediated by the galactosylceramide receptor and the CXCR4 chemokine coreceptor.

These properties were caused by the specific carboxyl-terminal region of CXCL12γ, which, by interacting with CXCR4 sulfotyrosines mediated high-affinity, but nonproductive, binding to CXCR4.

Here, we show that the β-arrestin1·signal-transducing adaptor molecule 1 (STAM1) complex, initially identified to govern lysosomal trafficking of CXCR4, also mediates CXCR4-dependent chemotaxis.

With these methods, we transfected uRPCs to overexpress CXCR4, an important chemokine receptor that mediates uRPC migration to the kidneys after intravenous injection, and demonstrate that CXCR4-uRPCs exhibit enhanced migration compared to mock-transfected cells.

Mechanistic investigations revealed that CXCR4 functionally mediated the SDF-1-stimulated activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in NPC cells with miR-9 downregulation or CXCR4 overexpression.

Recent reports indicate that interactions between the CXC chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 and its receptor CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) critically mediate the ischemia-induced recruitment of bone marrow-derived circulating stem/progenitor cells, but the expression of CXCR4 in cardiac progenitor cells is very low.

Furthermore, these effects were largely abolished by the addition of a CXCR4 inhibitor, indicating that the benefits of hypoxic preconditioning are mediated by the stromal cell-derived factor 1/CXCR4 axis, and that therapies targeting this axis may enhance cardiac-progenitor cell-based regenerative therapy.

We show that the interaction between MEDI3185 and CXCR4 is mediated mostly by CDR3H in MEDI3185 and ECL2 in CXCR4.

The [ D-Lys3]-GHRP-6-induced activation of autophagy was found to be abolished by the co-treatment of CXCR4 antagonist, suggesting that the pro-autophagic effects of [ D-Lys3]-GHRP-6 might be mediated through CXCR4.

Abrogation of surface CXCR4 expression impaired SDF-1α directed migration and was mediated through transcriptional down-regulation of PIM1 kinase that in turn phosphorylates CXCR4 and facilitates its surface localization.

Here, we show that CXCR4 antagonist expression from an oncolytic vaccinia virus delivered intravenously to mice with neuroblastoma tumors augmented efficacy of the DC vaccines compared to treatments mediated by a soluble CXCR4 antagonist or oncolysis alone.

We determined that (a) CXCL12/CXCR4 transactivation of EGFR and HER2 is confined to lipid raft membrane microdomains, (b) CXCL12 activation of HER2 and Src is mediated by small GTP proteins in lipid rafts, (c) inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis through plerixafor abrogates the initial establishment of tumor growth without affecting the growth of established bone tumors, and (d) inhibition of EGFR signaling through gefitinib leads to inhibition of established bone tumor growth.

LSEC-expressed CXCR4 mediated CXCL12 transport and blockage of endothelial CXCR4 inhibited CXCL12-dependent CD4(+) T-cell transmigration.

NAMPT inhibits CXCR4 through a NAD/Sirtuin 1-mediated inactivation of HIF1α-driven CXCR4 gene transcription, leading to mobilization of immature myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and enhancing their production of suppressive nitric oxide.

These data indicate that the decreased association of YY1 with c-Myc that is caused by impaired interaction in the c-Myc/Max/Mad network results in increased binding activity of YY1 to the CXCR4 promoter mediating down-regulation of CXCR4 production in HHV-6-infected cells.

The CD4(2D) CXCR4 hybrid mediated infection by HIV-1(LAI) to nearly the same extent as the wild-type molecules, whereas CD4(4D) CXCR4 was less efficient.

The rat CXCR4 cannot mediate infection by HIV-1NDK or by FIVPET (both cell line-adapted strains) because of sequence differences with human CXCR4 in the second extracellular loop (ECL2).

The feline homolog of the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has recently been shown to support cell-cell fusion mediated by CXCR4-dependent strains of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and strains of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) that have been selected for growth in the Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cell line.

The inhibition of infection was less efficient for CXCR4 lacking the COOH-terminal domain, suggesting at least in part that SDF-1 inhibition of virus infection was mediated through ligand-induced internalization of CXCR4.

Thus, for viruses with a low or medium CCR5-specificity the role of g15 for changing CCR5-usage and sensitivity to neutralization was more significant than for viruses with high infection rates on GHOST-CCR5 cells.

Evolution often involves switch of coreceptor use from CCR5 to CXCR4, but change to more flexible use of CCR5 occurs over time even in patients with maintained CCR5 use.

Studies of the leporid CCR5 gene revealed a very dramatic change unique in mammals at the second extracellular loop of CCR5 resulting from a gene conversion event with the paralogous CCR2.

Thus, the identification of factors and mechanisms that impact the expression of CCR5 in the brain is critical, as changes in CCR5 levels may affect the infection in the brain.

Knockdown or enhancement of CCR5AS expression resulted in a corresponding change in CCR5 expression on CD4+ T cells.

Mutating the CCR5 dimerization interface changed conformation of the CCR5 homodimers and modulated differentially the binding of distinct gp120s.

One possible explanation is that ligand competition at the CCR5 receptor or changed CCR5 availability may shape the outcome of HIV-1 infection.

CXCR4 did not interact with CCR5, the other principal HIV-1 coreceptor, when the two proteins were coexpressed.

specifically, HIV-X4 viruses interact with CXCR4 while HIV-R5 interact with CCR5 co-receptors.

Plasma stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 levels, SDF1-3\A polymorphism, and CXCR4(+) T lymphocytes in relation to resistance to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 infection and its progression were investigated in a study of HIV-positive patients, exposed but uninfected (EU) subjects, and healthy control subjects, all lacking CCR5 Delta 32 homozygosity.

The 239 envelope uses CCR5 for infection of memory CD4(+) T cells, the 316 envelope also uses CCR5 but has enhanced infectivity for primary macrophages, and the 155 T3 envelope uses CXCR4 for infection of both naive and memory CD4(+) T cells.

IgE-FcepsilonRI interactions significantly increased expression of CXCR4 mRNA (approximately 400-to 1800-fold)  enhanced prMC susceptibility to X4 and R5X4 virus (approximately 3000-to 16, 0-fold), but had no significant effect on CD4, CCR3, or CCR5 expression, susceptibility to R5 virus, or degranulation.

As discussed previously, the theoretic concern exists that blocking CCR5 could enhance the emergence of CXCR4-using variants and possibly accelerate disease.

Downmodulation of CCR5 by RANTES was decreased and recycling of CCR5 was accelerated in SF T cells when compared with peripheral blood (PB) T cells.

CCR5 patchiness is, therefore, a signature of liver metastases in our cohort (n = 97 specimens) and relates to globally decreased expression intensity, but does not influence the extent of the response to CCR5 inhibitor Maraviroc in patients.

Delayed progression in Caucasian LTNP is also partly associated with heterozygosity of the Δ32 CCR5 allele, probably through decreased expression of CCR5 co-receptor on CD4 T-cells.

There was no difference in CD195 expression between these patients with GD or HD with different severities, but there was a decreased intensity of CD195(+) cells in thyrotoxic patients with GD.

Neutralization of IFN-gamma increased CCR5 expression and decreased CC-chemokine secretion by CD4(+) clones from healthy and IL-12Rbeta1(-/-) individuals, suggesting an IFN-gamma-dependent control of CCR5 expression.

Furthermore, the level of CCR5 expression was directly correlated with the viral load, consistent with the protective mechanism in which a decrease in CCR5 molecules on CD4(+) T cells decreases HIV-1 envelope binding.

In addition, we found enhanced IL-10 production by CCR5-deficient peritoneal macrophages and decreased tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha production by CCR5-/- T cells in comparison with CCR5+/+ controls.

Transduction with both siRNAs substantially reduced CCR5 mRNA, which in turn decreased detectable cell membrane CCR5.

DT-13 reduced VEGF and CCR5 mRNAs, and decreased CCR5 protein expression by down-regulating HIF-1α.

CCR5KO mice presented a lower PD severity (lower inflammation and alveolar bone loss) when compared with the WT strain, since the migration of F4/80+, TNF-α+, CD4+, and RANKL+ cells specifically decreased due to the lack of CCR5.

Because patients with frailty demonstrate an overexpression of CCR5, rapamycin (RAPA) and/or maraviroc (MVC), two molecules able to decrease CCR5 expression, were evaluated.

The CCR5-CD4 association, which occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, enhanced CCR5 export to the plasma membrane in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas inhibition of endogenous CD4 with small interfering RNAs decreased cell-surface expression of endogenous CCR5.

CCR5 blockade resulted in decreased levels of CCR5+ T cells in blood and, at later timepoints, in lymph nodes.

When CD45RO positive PB T cells were cultured with interleukin 2, blunted responsiveness to RANTES-induced chemotaxis was reproduced as well as spontaneous chemotaxis increased expression of CCR5, and aberrant receptor dynamics, after RANTES stimulation as observed in SF T cells.

Here, we show that by limiting transcription of specific ceramide synthases, CCR5 signaling reduces ceramide levels and thereby increases T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) nanoclustering in antigen-experienced mouse and human CD4+ T cells.

During allograft rejection, expression of CXCR3, but not CCR5 increases on peripheral CD4+ T cells prior to clinical evidence of allograft rejection and remains elevated for more than 2 weeks following transplantation.

Unexpectedly, we found an earlier time to onset and a worsening of GVHD using CCR5(-/-) T cells, which was associated with significant increases in the accumulation of alloreactive CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in liver and lung.

MS-A showed a significant increase of CD4(+) CD45RA(-) CCR5(+) cells (Th1 cells) through the relapse and remission phases in comparison to HC, while MS-W showed a significant increase of CD4(+) CD45RO(+) CD62L(-) cells (Th1 cells) only at the relapse phase.

chabaudi malaria increased expression of mucosal homing integrin α4β7 on blood CD4 and CD8 T cells, and these α4β7 T cells had significantly increased co-expression of both CCR5 and CD38.

Changes in the cellular composition of HiLNs included decreased proportions of CD4 cells and dendritic cells and increased proportions of CD8, CXCR3, and CCR5 cells.

However, we report that CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion is also associated with a dramatic induction of proliferation among CD4(+) effector memory T (T(EM)) cells and, to a lesser extent, transitional memory T (T(TrM)) cells, raising the question of whether an increased availability of optimal (activated/proliferating), CD4(+)/CCR5(+) SIV " target" cells contributes to this accelerated pathogenesis.

Patients\ CCR5+CD38+HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells were further validated and shown to display increases in CD45RA+CCR7- and T-bet+ accompanied by substantial CD107-a, IFN-γ, and Granzyme B levels in response to glioma cells.

In general, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing Ki67 transiently increased in all mucosal tissues, but those expressing the CCR5, HLA-DR, and CD103 markers exhibited minor changes.

Furthermore, levels of gene-marked CD4(+) T-cells in peripheral blood increased despite systemic infection with either CXCR4- or CCR5- tropic HIV-1 in vivo.

Maraviroc, a CCR5-antagonist, has resulted in larger increases in CD4(+) counts both in naïve and experienced subjects compared to traditional antiretroviral therapy.

We compared CD4 cell count increases associated with chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) inhibitors or other new drugs, using indirect comparison.

CCR5 inhibitors did not increase CD4 cell count to a greater extent than other new drugs.

Primary HIV-1 isolates were weakly neutralized, preincubation with soluble CD4 enhanced neutralization, and engineered isolates with increased dependence on the N terminus of CCR5 or with reduced conformational barriers were neutralized with IC(50) values as low as ∼1 μM.

G312V and A204E Env variants continued to require CCR5 for entry but were up to 50-and 200-fold more sensitive to neutralization by IgG1b12 and soluble CD4 and had a 5-to 50-fold increase in their ability to utilize Ptm CD4 compared to their wild-type counterparts.

The magnitude of macrophage entry by Env-pseudotyped reporter viruses correlated with increased immunoreactivity of CD4-induced gp120 epitopes increased ability to scavenge low levels of cell-surface CCR5, reduced sensitivity to the CCR5 inhibitor maraviroc, and increased dependence on specific residues in the CCR5 ECL2 region.

M1 polarization was associated with a significant down-regulation of CD4 receptors increased secretion of CCR5-binding chemokines (CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5), and a & gt.

It is approved for use in ART-experienced patients with CCR5-tropic HIV, and was found to significantly reduce HIV viral load and increase CD4+ cell count when combined with an optimized background ART regimen (OBR).

Although ethanol had a limited effect on the acute plasma viral load, it resulted in reduced circulating memory CD4(+) T cells and increased levels of monocytes expressing the viral coreceptor CCR5.

Notably, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ T cells in SF expressed increased levels of inflammation-related trafficking chemokine receptors, such as CCR4, CCR5, and CXCR4.

The total CD4+ T(EM)-cell pool underwent immune activation in controllers, as indicated by increased HLA-DR expression, decreased IL-7Ralpha expression, a bias towards gamma interferon production upon polyclonal stimulation, and increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta secretion associated with chronic CCR5 down-regulation.

In line with an increased susceptibility to HIV infection, PD-1 expression in this CD4 T cell subset was associated with increased activation and expression of the HIV co-receptor, CCR5.

A significantly lower expression of HO-1 in co-infected individuals compared to patients with only HIV-infection having comparable CD4 count correlated well with increased expression of CCR5 and CxCR4 as well as NF-κB and inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α, which collectively may contribute to enhanced viral replication and increased cell death, hence faster disease progression in co-infected individuals.

When CD4 signaling was blocked by soluble CD4 or protein kinase inhibitors, p38 activation and Fas-independent cell death were increased among uninfected CD4+ CCR5+ T cells.

These alterations are necessary for the redistribution of CD4-CXCR4/CCR5 to one pole of the cell, a process that increases the probability of HIV-1 Envelope (Env)-CD4/co-receptor interactions and that generates the tension at the plasma membrane necessary to potentiate fusion pore formation, thereby favouring early HIV-1 infection.

The percentage of CD4+ T cells in CVL was not increased after implant placement but the percentage of CD4+ T cells expressing the HIV co-receptor CCR5 did increase after implant placement (p = 0.02).

Consistent with these observations, CD4-Ig, but none of the CD4bs antibodies tested, substantially increased HIV-1 infection of a CD4-negative, CCR5-positive cell line.

Significantly lower numbers of CD4 T cells in patients with X4 variants (n = 18) compared to patients with non-syncytium inducing/CCR5 using variants (n = 74) were due to increased loss of naive and CD27 memory CD4 T cells.

Furthermore, the cell surface density of CCR5 is increased on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte subsets.

In this study, we observed (i) no signs of simian AIDS, (ii) stable SIV loads, (iii) a slow but progressive decline in CD4(+) T-cell counts (from a mean of 1, 67.0 cells/mm(3) at time point 1 to 764.8 cells/mm(3) at time point 3) and increases in the numbers of animals with CD4(+) T-cell levels below 500 and 200 cells/mm(3) (from 8 to 28 of 78 and from 1 to 4 of 78, respectively), (iv) progressive declines in percentages of naïve CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells (from 37.7 to 24.8 % and from 21.0 to 13.0 %, respectively), and (v) stably low levels of activated/proliferating T cells as well as CD4(+) CCR5(+) T cells.

As determined by plasma viral RNA and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) proviral DNA, we show improved suppression of productive HIV infection in human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell-engrafted NOD (nonobese diabetic)-SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency)-il2rg-/- (NSG) mice by combined treatment with cART and CCR5 targeting drugs, compared with cART alone, as well as an increased preservation of human CD4+ T cells (defined as CD45+ CD3+ CD4+ cells) and CD4+/CD8+ cell ratios in infected mice.

Analysis of tumor lesions in wild-type (WT) and CCR5KO mice revealed that lack of CCR5 lead to significant reduction in frequency of Tregs and increased of CD4 T cells into the tumors.

When compared with PBMCs, testes were characterized by a lower CD4 T-cell proportion among total T cells, a decrease in the frequency of naive cells, an increase in the frequency of effector-memory T cells and an increase in CCR5 expression in both the HIV+ and HIV- groups.

While the expression of CCR5, CCR6, CD95, CD127, and CD150 has increased in untreated subjects compared with that in HDs, CD45RO has declined in untreated subjects in both DN MAITs and CD8(hi) MAITs.

Compared to Ccr5(+/+) mice, Ccr5(-/-) mice unexpectedly showed increased responses of IFN-γ(+) NK and CD8(+) T cells in the spleen, but not CD4(+) T cells.

The expression of chemokine receptors (CD195 and CXCR2) and an adhesion molecule (CD54) increased by CSC treatment, the expression of certain antigen presentation-related proteins (MHC class II, CD40, and CD80) were also enhanced.

Further analysis of donor hearts in the anti-CCR5 antibody plus rapa-treated group demonstrated increased infiltration of CD4(+) CD25(+) forkhead box P3(+) regulatory T cells, and depletion of CD25(+) cells resulted in acute rejection of allografts in 18 +/- 1 day.

Down-regulation of CCL19, CCR5, CCR7, interferon gamma and interleukin (IL)-12 in the combination treatment was accompanied by increased expression of IL-4, IL-10 and CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Tr) cells in spleen.

The presence of CCR5 significantly increased IL-16 binding vs CD4 alone.

CCR5-deficient mice showed increased frequency and absolute number of IL-17-producing CD4+ Th17 cells in lung tissues compared to wild-type mice, whereas the reduced infiltration of CD4+FoxP3+ Treg cells was observed.

Disruption of CCR5 expression by lentiviral vector-mediated CRISPR/SaCas9 led to increased resistance against HIV-1 infection in human primary CD4+ T cells.

Inoculations resulted in transient increases in CD4(+) T-cell activation and proliferation, as well as a sustained increase in CD4(+) T cells coexpressing CCR5 and α4β7 integrin.

HD-HIV cells showed decreased CD4, but significant increase in the expression of CCR5, CXCR4, Nef-associated factor HCK, and Vpu-associated factor BTRC.

In addition, after removal of CD4(+)/CCR5(+) T cells, the number of CFUs was increased in those patients with a higher number of BM Th1 (CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+)) cells, hypocellularity, or bearing the DR15 allele.

Expanded Ad5 and Ad11 memory CD4 T cells showed an increase in CCR5 expression and higher susceptibility to infection by R5 tropic HIV-1.

Whereas SIV-infected RM show selective numeric preservation of CD4(+) T(SCM), SIV infection induced a complex perturbation of these cells defined by depletion of CD4(+) CCR5(+) T(SCM)  increased rates of CD4(+) T(SCM) proliferation, and high levels of direct virus infection.

Valacyclovir did not reduce the number of cervical CD4(+) T cells, the number of dendritic cells, or the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and tended to increase the expression of the HIV coreceptor CCR5 and the activation marker CD69.

Potential mechanisms include lower CD4+ T cell expression of CCR5 and CCR7, balanced by increased CD4 expression and cytokine levels, which did not result in in vitro resistance to HIV infection.

Repeated semen exposures result in lower CCR5 expression in circulating CD4+ T-cells, as well as higher expression of Mx1 (in correlation with IFNε expression) and FoxP3 in the cervicovaginal mucosa, and increased infiltration of CD4+ T-cells.

HIV susceptibility markers CCR5 and CD38 were increased on FGT CCR7(hi) CD4 T cells compared with blood, yet migration to the lymphoid homing chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 was maintained.

Although not required for CD4-dependent fusion, this interaction may serve to increase the binding affinity of Env and CCR5 and/or to facilitate subsequent conformational changes that are required for fusion.

Influenza virus infection of HeLa-CD4 cells resulted in a marked increase in susceptibility to infection by CXCR4-dependent but not CCR5-dependent HIV isolates.

Decreased CCR5 and increased CD4 binding appear to be common features of coreceptor switch intermediates.

Stimulation with heat-killed extracts of Mycobacterium tuberculosis down-modulated cell surface expression of CCR5 on gammadelta T cells in a macrophage-dependent manner, while synthetic phosphoantigen isopentenyl pyrophosphate and CCR5 ligands directly triggered CCR5 down-modulation on gammadelta T cells.

Stimulation of CCR5 by chemokines triggers internalization of chemokine-bound CCR5 molecules in a process called down-modulation, which contributes to the anti-HIV activity of chemokines.

IL-7 pretreatment of naive T cells also potently up-regulated surface expression of CXCR4 but not CCR5 and mediated the expansion of naive T cells without the acquisition of the primed CD45RO phenotype.

It is a major coreceptor with CD4 glycoprotein mediating cellular entry of CCR5 strains of HIV-1.

Some retroviruses such as HIV-1 and HIV-2 utilize one receptor for high-affinity binding (CD4), and a separate coreceptor to mediate fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane (CCR5 or CXCR4).

Here, we show that the conserved central region of the second variable loop (V2) of gp120 contains sulfated tyrosines (Tys173 and Tys177) that in the CD4-unbound prefusion state mediate intramolecular interaction between V2 and the conserved base of the third variable loop (V3), functionally mimicking sulfated tyrosines in CCR5 and anti-coreceptor-binding-site antibodies such as 412 d.

Here we show that early-time-point and control Envs were strictly CD4 dependent but that, by day 42 postinfection, plasma virus of CD4(+) T cell-depleted RM was dominated by Envs that mediate efficient infection using RM CCR5 independently of CD4.

Two discoveries in 1996 presented a novel opportunity to redress this issue: 1) the understanding that heptahelical G-protein coupled chemokine receptors on the surface of T cells and macrophages functioned together with CD4 to mediate viral entry, and 2) the observation that CD4 positive T cells from individuals homozygous for the CCR5 delta 32 null allele were resistant to infection by macrophage-tropic strains of the virus in vitro and in vivo.

Here, we show that Fab fragments and complete immunoglobulin molecules of CD4BS antibodies inhibit CD4-independent gp120 binding to CCR5 and cell-cell fusion mediated by CD4-independent HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins.

Treatment of human osteosarcoma cells, expressing CD4 and various chemokine receptors, with the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PPMP), blocked target membrane glycosphingolipid (GSL) biosynthesis and reduced the susceptibility of cells to infection and fusion mediated by envelope glycoproteins from a variety of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates that utilize CXCR4 and/or CCR5.

The major HIV-1 coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4 mediate virus entry into CD4+ cells and are therefore a critical component of the HIV-1 life cycle.

CCR5 is also the major coreceptor that mediates HIV infection in combination with CD4.

CD4-dependent variants mediated efficient entry using human CCR5, whereas CD4-independent variants had impaired use of human CCR5.

The human C-C chemokine receptor type-5 (CCR5) is the major transmembrane co-receptor that mediates HIV-1 entry into target CD4+ cells.

In conjunction with studies of SIVsmm, which infects sooty mangabeys, and SIVagmVer, which infects vervet monkeys, our data suggest a unifying model whereby in natural hosts, in which the CCR5 expression level is low, the use of CXCR6 or other coreceptors to mediate infection may target SIV toward distinct cell populations that are able to support high-level viral replication without causing a loss of CD4+ T cell homeostasis and lymphoid tissue damage that lead to AIDS in HIV-1 and SIVmac infections.

By contrast, infection of monocyte-derived dendritic cells and transfer of infection from monocyte-derived dendritic cells to CD4+ T cells were mediated by CCR5-dependent as well as DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing nonintegrin-dependent pathways.

HIV uptake by CD4(+) T cells was dependent on cellular contacts mediated by the binding of gp120 to CD4 but was independent of the expression of the appropriate HIV coreceptor, CCR5 or CXCR4.

Our studies suggest that CD4-independent use of CXCR4 can be mediated by different adaptive changes related to the microenvironment of CD4(-) cell.

Differentiated HCT116 cells had increased expression of cell surface C-X-C chemokine receptor type-4 (CXCR4) that mediated HIV entry, despite the apparent absence of cell surface CD4.

A CD4-independent version of the X4 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) HXBc2 envelope (Env) protein, termed 8 x mediates infection of CD4-negative, CXCR4-positive cells, binds directly to CXCR4 in the absence of CD4 due to constitutive exposure of a conserved coreceptor binding site in the gp120 subunit, and is more sensitive to antibody-mediated neutralization.

Infectious CXCR4-tropic HIV-1, but not matched inactivated virions or gp120 mediated CD4(+) T-cell depletion, consistent with mechanisms requiring productive infection.

As use of CXCR4 improved, infection mediated by the mutated envelopes became more resistant to soluble CD4 inhibition and direct binding to CD4 increased.

Binding of the FIV major surface glycoprotein on activated CD4+ T cells was observed through direct interaction with CD134 whereas, on activated CD8+ T cells, the binding was CD134-independent and mediated by CXCR4 and, to a lesser extent, heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

Recently, the alpha-chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been reported to mediate apoptosis in neuronal cells and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells after its binding to HIV-1 envelope proteins.

HIV fusion and entry into CD4 T cells are mediated by two receptors, CD4 and CXCR4.

Expression of an 85 aa fragment of the GBV-C NS5A phosphoprotein (genotype 2) in a CD4+ T cell line (Jurkat) resulted in inhibition of HIV replication mediated in part by decreased surface expression of the HIV coreceptor CXCR4 and upregulation of SDF-1.

Compared with patient X4 viruses, the gp120-gp41 complexes of LA viruses have a constellation of common properties including enhanced affinities for CD4, greater sensitivities to inactivations by diverse antibodies and by soluble CD4 increased shedding of gp120, and improved abilities to infect HeLa-CD4 cell clones that contain only trace quantities of CD4.

T-bet is a key regulator for the lineage commitment in CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cells by activating the hallmark production of interferon-γ.

Mice immunized with a VLP bearing the aryl mannoside, and a peptide antigen (Qβ-Ova-Man540) had antigen-specific responses, including the production of CD4+ T cells producing the activating cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α.

We further identified that FUS1-hIL-12 coexpression could induce strong antitumor immune response by secreting much higher levels of human interferon-γ (hIFN-γ) and hIL-15, enhancing expression of MHC-I and Fas, increasing infiltration of activated human CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.

The generation of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by MHC class II activated CD4+ T helper cells play a substantial contribution in the control of infections such as caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Since SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS has a strong immunological component, many investigators are utilizing monoclonal antibodies against IL-6, TNF-alpha and CCR5.

While most of these CD44 functions are supposed to involve hyaluronan, relatively little is known about the contribution of CD44 to hyaluronan maintenance and organization on cell surface, and the role of CD44 in hyaluronan synthesis and catabolism.

Thus, it is unclear whether BAF57-dependent CD4 repression involves chromatin remodeling and, if so, how the remodeling translates into CD4 repression.

Because inflammation in these rats requires CD4+ T lymphocytes and involves intestinal pathology, we hypothesized that dendritic cells (DCs) that migrate from the intestine and control CD4+ T cell differentiation would be aberrant in B27-transgenic rats.

Our study demonstrates that G6b-B expression is highly restricted to peripheral CD4+ T cells and up-regulated by the IL-4-induced STAT6 pathway, strongly suggesting that G6b-B is involved in regulation of the immune response by CD4+ T cell-mediated and IL-4 induced regulatory mechanisms.

Together, these results indicate that the intrinsic expression of Stat5a in CD4(+) T cells is required for Th2 cell differentiation and that Stat5a is involved in the development of CD4(+) CD25(+) immunoregulatory T cells that modulate T helper cell differentiation toward Th2 cells.

The CD4/CXCR4 and CD8alpha/CXCR4 interactions may thus be involved in cellular signaling pathways shared by the CD4 and CD8alpha molecules.

To identify a cell surface molecule other than CD4 involved in infection of cultured cells with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), mice were immunized with the CD4-negative Raji human B-cell line in order to isolate a monoclonal antibody (mAb).

CD4 T cells are involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, but atherosclerosis-specific CD4 T cells have not been described.

This study provides important insights into the development of CD4+ Tfh cells during Plasmodium infection and highlights the heterogeneity of antigen-presenting cells involved in CD4+ T cell priming.

This effect resulted from the internalization of membrane CD4 T\240\cell molecules into clathrin-coated pits and involved disruption of the CD4/p56Lck complex.

Interestingly, blockade of the contact between ILC2s and CD4+T cells, may significantly diminish the CD4+T cell expansion and cytokine production, suggesting that membrane molecules may be involved in ILC2-regulated CD4+T cell activation.

The continual evolution of the influenza-specific CD4 T cell repertoire involves both specificity and function and overlays other restrictions on CD4 T cell activity derived from viral antigen handling and MHC class II:peptide epitope display.

Differentiation of CD4(+) helper and CD8(+) cytotoxic αβ T cells from CD4(+) CD8(+) thymocytes involves upregulation of lineage-specifying transcription factors and transcriptional silencing of CD8 or CD4 coreceptors, respectively, in MHC class II or I (MHCII or I)-restricted thymocytes.

Several studies have demonstrated that CD4(+) T cells are involved in protection against Mtb, as supported by the evidence that CD4(+) T cell depletion is responsible for Mtb reactivation in HIV-infected individuals.

We confirmed that EC from lymphatic tissue (LEC) were able to promote HIV infection and latency formation in resting CD4+ T cells while keeping them in resting phenotype, and that IL-6 was involved in LEC stimulation of CD4+ T cells.

We further identified CD4+ conventional DC (cDC) as the subset involved in airway antigen sampling in both strains, however, CD4+ cDC in the susceptible strain were less efficient in OVA sampling and displayed increased MHC-II expression compared with the resistant strain.

CD4+ T cell help to CD8+ T cell responses requires that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interact with the same antigen presenting dendritic cell (Ag+DC), but it remains controversial whether helper signals are delivered indirectly through a licensed DC and/or involve direct CD4+/CD8+ T cell contacts and/or the formation of ternary complexes.

This cell to cell transfer between CD4(+) T cells involves the formation of a virological synapse (VS), which is an F-actin-dependent cell-cell junction formed upon the engagement of HIV-1 envelope gp120 on the infected cell with CD4 and the chemokine receptor (CKR) CCR5 or CXCR4 on the target cell (8).

HIV infects and replicates in CD4+ T cells but effects on host immunity and disease also involve depletion, hyper-activation, and modification of CD4-negative cell populations.

Overall, the adaptation process probably involves selection for variants with higher CD4 affinity and hence greater fusion efficiency, but this also involves the loss of some resistance to neutralization by agents directed at or near to the CD4BS.

We demonstrate here that while introduction of the 8 x FS mutation into heterologous R5, X4, or R5X4 Env proteins did not impart CD4 independence, it did affect the conformation of the gp120 surface subunit, exposing highly conserved domains involved in both coreceptor and CD4 binding.

IMPORTANCE CD4 T cell depletion during HIV-1 infection involves the demise of bystander CD4 T cells due to abortive infection, viral DNA sensing, inflammasome assembly, and death by caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis.

We conclude that binding of gp120 to CD4 molecules on T cells may interrupt the sequential cascade of intercellular interaction involving 1) Ag/MHC class II-TCR/CD4, 2) CD40L-CD40, and 3) B71-CD28.

Since MHC class II expression did not influence the degree of conjugate formation by naive or memory CD4 T cells with B cells, CD4-MHC class II interaction does not appear to be involved in binding itself, but may down-regulate the adhesion of memory but not naive CD4 T cells.

These findings indicate that the CD4+ Th defect seen in the majority of asymptomatic, HIV+ individuals is not limited to recall antigens, but also extends to the component of the response to HLA alloantigens that involves the self-restricted, CD4+ Th pathway.

Subsequently, CD4 is downregulated in infected cells by multiple strategies that involve direct interactions of the HIV-1 proteins VpU and Nef with the cytoplasmic part of CD4.

Blocking hyaluronan binding either by CD44 antibodies, CD44-siRNA or hyaluronan decasaccharides (but not hexasaccharides) removed most of the hyaluronan from the surfaces of both human (HaCaT) and mouse keratinocytes, resembling results on cells from CD44⁻/⁻ animals.

Antigen recognition by alloreactive MHC class I-restricted CD4(+) T cells was inhibited by removing peptides bound to HLA molecules on T2 cells suggesting that the alloreactive CD4(+) T cells recognize peptides that bind in a TAP-independent manner to HLA-A2 molecules.

Our data indicate that CD44 retains hyaluronan in the keratinocyte pericellular matrix, a fact that has not been shown unambiguously before, and that hyaluronan abundance in the absence of CD44 can result in hyaluronan trapping in abnormal locations possibly interfering there with normal differentiation and epidermal barrier function.

Although CD4-independent variants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) have been described that can utilize the coreceptor CCR5 or CXCR4 in the absence of CD4, these viruses typically retain their CD4 binding sites and still can interact with CD4.

Although CD4-independent viruses are well described for HIV and SIV, these viruses characteristically retain their CD4 binding site and can engage CD4 if available.

Assessment of the neutralization properties of CD4M47 against a diverse range of isolates spanning from HIV-1 to SIVcpz showed that CD4M47 retained the extraordinary breadth of the parent CD4M33, but yielded only limited improvements in neutralization potencies.

Both CD4-independent laboratory isolates retained sensitivity to BMS-626529 in CD4(-) cells, while HIV-1 envelopes from viruses resistant to BMS-626529 exhibited no evidence of a CD4-independent phenotype.

Here, we demonstrate that the envelope gene of intestinal cell-adapted virus conferred to recombinant clone HIV-1 iNDK the ability to utilize CXCR4 without CD4 while retaining its tropism for CD4 lymphocytes.

We report that all CD4 mutants that retain raft partitioning mediate HIV-1 entry and CD4-induced Lck activation independently of their transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains.

By depletion of AC and/or CD8+ Th subsets (to analyze CD4+ Th function), we demonstrated that HIV+ patients who were selectively deficient in Th function to recall antigens were also unresponsive to Allo presented by autologous AC (HLA self-restricted Th pathway), but retained Allo Th activity presented by allogeneic AC (allo-restricted CD4+ Th pathway).

The mutation Q40P (Gln40----Pro) and the deletion d42-49 were found to disrupt most antibody epitopes in the V1 domain of CD4, suggesting major conformational changes, whereas mutants F43L, G47R, and P48S retained the binding of most of the anti-CD4 antibodies tested.

The previous epidemics of infections by high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2.

In spite of the high sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 with its closely related SARS-CoV emerged in 2002, the atomic-level determinants underlining the molecular recognition of SARS-CoV-2 to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and, thus, the rapid virus spread into human body, remain unresolved.

In the present work we performed a genetic analysis of the Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and other related coronaviruses (CoVs) isolated from different hosts in order to trace the evolutionary history of this protein and the adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to humans.

Despite initial findings indicating that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are genetically related belonging to the same virus species and that the two viruses used the same entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), our data demonstrated that there is no detectable cross-neutralization by SARS patient sera against SARS-CoV-2.

Therefore, we may speculate that the different hormonal milieu could have a more profound pathophysiological role in association with SARS-CoV-2, with endogenous testosterone leaving men more prone to develop more serious complications related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For this reason, we investigated the involvement of genetic factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection with a focus on angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related genes, because ACE2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2.

The increased expression of these SARS-CoV-2 cell entry associated genes in the placenta during the first trimester compared to later stages of pregnancy suggest the possibility of differential susceptibility to placental entry to SARS-CoV-2 across pregnancy.

Although SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a lower mortality rate than are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, its higher infectivity is making it a far more serious threat.

Using steered all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that, like a coarse-grained simulation, SARS-CoV-2-RBD was associated with ACE2-PD more strongly than was SARS-CoV-RBD, as evidenced by a higher rupture force and larger pulling work.

Whilst research all over the world is still struggling to provide a detailed characterization of the biology of SARS-CoV2 and its associated disease profile, it has become evident that SARS-CoV2 uses the membrane-bound form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell internalization.

Studies from the most affected countries, including China, United States and Italy, seem to indicate that prevalence of diabetes among patients affected by COVID-19 is not higher than that observed in the general population, thus suggesting that diabetes is not a risk factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

During the development of a pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 system, a eukaryotic expression plasmid expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein was constructed and then co-transfected with HIV-1 based plasmid which containing the firefly luciferase reporter gene, into HEK293T cells to prepare the pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus (ppSARS-2).

Upon challenge with a human isolate of SARS-CoV-2, mice that expressed human ACE2 and were immunized with VSV-eGFP-SARS-CoV-2 show profoundly reduced viral infection and inflammation in the lung, indicating protection against pneumonia.

These features may be attributable to the following facts: (a) COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and its receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was found to be highly expressed in GI epithelial cells, providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) has been identified as a functional receptor of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), so its gene was cloned and eukaryotic expressed for further insight into mechanisms in SARS-CoV entry and pathogenesis, as well as development of a safe and reliable neutralization assay for SARS-CoV.

Using the single-round infection assay, we found that a two-amino acid substitution (N479K/T487S) of a huSARS-CoV for those of pcSARS-CoV almost abolished its infection of human cells expressing the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 but no effect upon the infection of mouse ACE2 cells.

One scFv 80 R efficiently neutralized SARS-CoV and inhibited syncytia formation between cells expressing the S protein and those expressing the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without azithromycin have been widely promoted to treat COVID-19 following early in vitro antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess whether chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin decreased COVID-19 mortality compared to the standard of care.

Hydroxychloroquine seems to promote a reduction in viral load, in vivo studies, preventing the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into lung cells, and the safety of its administration is questioned due to the toxic effects that it can develop, such as retinopathy, hypoglycemia and even cardiotoxicity.

The gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) release Elispot assay revealed that only SARS-CoV-specific peptides S1203 and S978 induced a high frequency of IFN-gamma-secreting T-cell response in HLA-A2(+) donors who had fully recovered from SARS-CoV infection.

These results indicate that SARS-CoV infection induces strong and long-lasting CTL-mediated immunity in surviving SARS patients, and that cross-reactive memory T cells to SARS-CoV may exist in the T cell repertoire of a small subset of healthy individuals and can be reactivated by SARS-CoV infection.

immunization with rADV encoding spike protein (S) (rADV-S) of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces protective immunity against SARS-CoV and could serve as a safe mucosal route for delivery of rADV.

With an intraperitoneal (IP) immunization protocol, inactivated SARS-CoV alone induced significant amounts of SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies in sera and a small quantity of SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in the genital tract and feces, but failed to induce any detectable SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera, saliva, lung, and intestine, and the addition of CpG ODN 2006 had only a marginal effect on antibody production.

In contrast, with an intranasal (IN) immunization protocol, inactivated SARS-CoV alone failed to induce any detectable SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera, saliva, lung, and intestine, except for a small quantity of IgA antibodies in fecal extracts and the genital tract, along with IgG antibodies in sera, but when given with adjuvant CpG ODN 2006, inactivated SARS-CoV induced significant amounts of SARS-CoV-specific IgG antibodies in sera, and a detectable amount of SARS-CoV-specific IgA antibodies in sera and all tested mucosal secretions and tissues (i.

Our previous studies have shown that a candidate SARS vaccine antigen consisting of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike protein can induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated animals.

These SARS-CoV vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection with SARS-CoV.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the intraperitoneal and intranasal co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine together with this improved Poly (I:C) derivative induced strong anti-SARS-CoV mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses with neutralizing activity against pseudotyped virus.

Although intraperitoneal immunization of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine alone could induce a certain level of neutralizing activity in serum as well as in mucosal sites, co-administration of inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine with PIKA as adjuvant could induce a much higher neutralizing activity.

Practical actions against the recent emergence and rapid expansion of the SARS-CoV-2 require the development and use of tools for discovering new molecular anti-SARS-CoV-2 targets.

The outbreak of pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 posed a great threat to global human health, which urgently requires us to understand comprehensively the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These results suggest that when SARS-CoV binds ACE2 it is internalized and penetrates early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner and that the cytoplasmic tail of ACE2 is not required for the penetration of SARS-CoV.

According to the different studies on SARS-CoV-2 disinfection, because of the SARS-CoV-2 can remain in the air and on surfaces, as well as observing individual disinfection guidelines in different hospital areas, disinfection of surfaces is necessary to decrease SARS-CoV-2 spreading.

Further, we provided evidence suggesting that the MAPK pathway, downstream of ACE2, mediates the potentiating role of SARS-CoV-2 on platelet activation, and that platelet ACE2 expression decreases following SARS-COV-2 stimulation.

Notably, the macrophages expressing ACE2 as direct host cells of SARS-CoV-2 secrete chemokine and inflammatory cytokines, as well as a decrease in cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to elevated exhaustion levels and dysfunctional diversity of T cells, that may be accountable for the " hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome" and subsequently acute cardiac injury and deteriorating cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 patients.

Thus, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 would decrease its infection ability much faster than SARS-CoV when the temperature rises.

The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex.

SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies could cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein, and SARS-CoV RBD-induced antisera could cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2, suggesting the potential to develop SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection.

The antibodies also effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to soluble ACE2, indicating that RBD-mFc may be further developed as a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Built on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 initiates its entry into human cells by the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), we extended a recently developed approach, EvoDesign, to design multiple peptide sequences that can competitively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD to inhibit the virus from entering human cells.

Finally, determining the structural-functional relationships of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 will provide new insights into inhibition of interactions between S protein and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and enable us to develop novel therapeutic approaches for novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

Overall, our study has revealed the presence of different key epitopes between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, which indicates the necessity to develop new prophylactic vaccine and antibody drugs for specific control of the COVID-19 pandemic although the available agents obtained from the SARS-CoV study are unneglectable.

Our study demonstrates that although both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 as a cellular receptor, the neutralization epitopes are not shared by these two closely-related viruses, highlighting challenges towards developing a universal vaccine against SARS-CoV related viruses.

Given the PLpro proteases of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV share significant homology, inhibitor developed for SARS-CoV PLpro is a promising starting point of therapeutic development.

The similarities have enabled the scientists to apply the basic scientific discoveries garnered from studying the structure and modus operandi of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV to develop therapies that specifically target SARS-CoV-2 and to develop vaccines to prevent COVID-19.

Mice that were immunised twice with the candidate SARS-CoV vaccine developed high antibody titres against the SARS-CoV spike protein and high levels of neutralising antibodies.

To investigate this dichotomy in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), we developed a transcriptional network model of SARS-CoV infection in mice and used the model to prioritize candidate regulatory targets for further investigation.

Furthermore, the immunoassay of SARS-CoV NP antigen developed could be an effective and sensitive method of diagnosing SARS-suspected individuals during a future SARS-CoV outbreak.

These anti-SARS-CoV NP MAbs, with their high specificity, are potentially ideal candidates for developing early and sensitive diagnostic assays for SARS-CoV.

Thus, VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein is useful for developing a rapid detection system for neutralizing antibody specific for SARS-CoV infection as well as studying the S-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV.

VSV-SARS-St19 will be useful for analysing the function of SARS-CoV-S protein and for developing rapid methods of detecting neutralizing antibodies specific for SARS-CoV infection.

Under the pressure of the accelerating COVID-19 pandemic caused by the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China in December 2019, novel and repurposed drugs were recently designed and identified for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction machinery, with the aim to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Healthy adults 18-55 and 65-85 years of age were randomized in an ongoing, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded dose-escalation study to receive 2 doses at 21-day intervals of placebo or either of 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified RNA vaccine candidates: BNT162b1, which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain, or BNT162b2, which encodes a prefusion stabilized membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike.

While vaccine development will hopefully quell the global pandemic of COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, small molecule drugs that can effectively control SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed.

67 specimens from 48 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a positive result by the Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2, Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG, or EUROIMMUN SARS-CoV-2 IgG assays and 5 control specimens were analyzed for the presence of neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2.

Predicting a rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within our region, the Department for Women\s and Children\s Health promptly decided (i) to revise the distribution of the clinical areas in order to create both designated COVID-19 and COVID-19-free areas with their own access, (ii) to reinforce infection prevention control (IPC) measures for all healthcare workers and administrative staff and (iii) to adopt the new " double-gate approach": a phone call pre-triage and nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 detection before the admission of all patients and caregivers.

We also detected low levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of 10 healthy controls not previously exposed to SARS-CoV-2, which is indicative of cross-reactivity due to past infection with \ common cold\ coronaviruses.

Cells with such features were mostly absent in SARS-CoV-2 responsive cells from both COVID-19 patients and healthy controls non-exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Here we use a large panel of human sera (63 SARS-CoV-2 patients and 71 control subjects) and hyperimmune sera from animals exposed to zoonotic CoVs to evaluate RBD\s performance as an antigen for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.

This review provides a comprehensive review of MHV in mice and SARS-CoV-2 in humans, thereby highlighting further translational avenues in the development of innovative strategies in controlling the detrimental course of SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) \240\infection and its severity can be explained by the concentration of glycosylated severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral particles in the lung epithelium, the concentration of glycosylated angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) in the lung epithelium, and the degree and control of the pulmonary immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein at approximately day 8 to 10 after symptom onset, which may be related to both.

These results show that a DNA vaccine encoding CRT linked to a SARS-CoV antigen is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and cellular immunity and may potentially be useful for control of infection with SARS-CoV.

Using mouse models of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, we have identified that the wound repair pathway controlled by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is critical to recovery from SARS-CoV-induced tissue damage.

The limit of detection (LoD) of SARs-CoV-2 from floor samples collected using the CGp or TMI swabs was similar or better than the CDC standard, further suggesting that swab type does not impact RNA recovery as measured by SARs-CoV-2.

Our predicted miRNA targets of the ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 might destabilize the ss-RNA translation of SARS-CoV-2 that has been established by more than 80 % of asymptomatic infected cases in Jordan due to host miRNA interactions.

Similarly, hypoxoside isolated from Hypoxis hemerocallidea and uzarin from Xysmalobium undulatum, were identified as a potential inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain and SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent polymerase.

Following immunization of mice and guinea pigs with INO-4800 we measure antigen-specific T cell responses, functional antibodies which neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 infection and block Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor, and biodistribution of SARS-CoV-2 targeting antibodies to the lungs.

SARS-CoV-2 RBD exhibited significantly higher binding affinity to ACE2 receptor than SARS-CoV RBD and could block the binding and, hence, attachment of SARS-CoV-2 RBD and SARS-CoV RBD to ACE2-expressing cells, thus inhibiting their infection to host cells.

We caracterized how a single mutation in the wildtype sequence of of SARS-CoV-2 could influence the peptide binding of SARS-CoV-2 variants to MHC class II, but not to MHC class I alleles.

The affinity between ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 S protein is much higher than that of ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV S protein, explaining why SARS-CoV-2 seems to be more readily transmitted from human to human.

Many efforts to design and screen therapeutics for the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic have focused on inhibiting viral host cell entry by disrupting ACE2 binding with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Since SARS-CoV-2 must bind with ACE2 before entering the host cells in humans, the distribution and expression of ACE2 may be critical for the target organ of the SARS-CoV-2 infection.

It was found that SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 with a higher affinity than SARS-CoV, which may partly explain that SARS-CoV-2 is much more infectious than SARS-CoV.

Although sharing a close evolutionary relationship with SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 differs in several key amino acid residues, allowing for stronger binding affinity with the human ACE2 receptor, which may account for the greater pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.

Such similarity in structure and sequence strongly indicate convergent evolution between the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV RBDs for improved binding to ACE2, although SARS-CoV-2 does not cluster within SARS and SARS-related coronaviruses1-35.

We show that SARS-CoV-2\240\S uses ACE2 to enter cells and that the receptor-binding domains of SARS-CoV-2\240\S and SARS-CoV S bind with similar affinities to human ACE2, correlating with the efficient spread of SARS-CoV-2 among humans.

Although, SARS-Cov-2 primarily causes lung infection through binding of ACE2 receptors present on the alveolar epithelial cells, yet it was recently reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was found in the faeces of infected patients.

Here, we used X-ray structures of human ACE2 bound to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV-2 to predict its binding to ACE2 proteins from different animals, including pets, farm animals, and putative intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2.

Despite the genomic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARSCoV, the spike glycoprotein and receptor binding domain in SARS-CoV-2 shows the considerable difference compared to SARS-CoV, due to the presence of several point mutations.

We carried out virtual screening of antiviral compounds targeting the spike glycoprotein (S), main protease (Mpro), and the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD)-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) complex of SARS-CoV-2.

The S proteins from SARS and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, but structural differences in the receptor binding domain (RBD) preclude the use of SARS-specific neutralizing antibodies to inhibit SARS-CoV-2.

It was reviewed that therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 receptor, viral RNA synthesis and replication, 3 CLpro, RdRp, and helicase will play a crucial role in the development of treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infection.

These findings suggest that the spike of SARS-CoV-2 could bind the ACE2 receptor of lagomorphs, and future studies should investigate the role of lagomorphs in SARS-CoV-2 epidemiology.

SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity to ACE2 is significantly higher (10-20 times) compared with SARS-CoV.

First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry.

Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.

SARS-CoV-2 binds much more strongly than SARS-CoV to the same host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

(Science2020, 367, 1260-1263) showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 peptidase domain (ACE2-PD) more strongly than does SARS-CoV, and this fact may be associated with a greater severity of the new virus.

Our data suggest that the mutations in SARS-CoV-2 lead to a greater binding affinity relative to SARS-CoV.

Abilities of mAbs generated against SARS-CoV-1 S protein to bind SARS-CoV-2 or its S protein were tested with SARS-CoV-2 infected cells as well as cells expressing either the full length protein or a fragment of its S2 subunit.

The epitopes of two SARS-CoV antibodies that target the RBD are also analysed for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, providing insights into the future identification of cross-reactive antibodies.

SARS-CoV binds to the metalloprotease angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), MERS-CoV utilizes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and recent modeling of the structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein predicts that it can interact with human DPP4 in addition to ACE2.

It suggests the interaction between SARS-CoV2 S spike protein complex might have different binding conformations, which request full-length of SARS-CoV2 S protein complex in the structure-functional analysis.

Both antibodies competed with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2, for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD), suggesting a mechanism of neutralization that involves interference with the SARS-CoV-ACE2 interaction.

The spike (S) protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is not only responsible for receptor binding and virus fusion, but also a major Ag among the SARS-CoV proteins that induces protective Ab responses.

We have expressed a series of truncated spike (S) glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and found that the N-terminus 14-502 residuals were sufficient to bind to SARS-CoV susceptible Vero E6 cells.

S1 domain of SARS-CoV spike, which has been demonstrated harboring the receptor binding domain, successfully elicited SARS-CoV specific IgG antibody in mouse after combined immunization with DNA and purified S1 protein.

Despite SL-CoVs and SARS-CoV share identical genome structure and high-level sequence similarity, SL-CoV does not bind to the same cellular receptor as for SARS-CoV and the N-terminus of the S proteins only share 64 % amino acid identity, suggesting there are fundamental differences between these two groups of coronaviruses.

m396, CR3014) that target the ACE2 binding site of SARS-CoV failed to bind 2019-nCoV spike protein, implying that the difference in the RBD of SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV has a critical impact for the cross-reactivity of neutralizing antibodies, and that it is still necessary to develop novel monoclonal antibodies that could bind specifically to 2019-nCoV RBD.

LF may play a protective role in host defense against SARS-CoV infection through binding to HSPGs and blocking the preliminary interaction between SARS-CoV and host cells.

One notable exception is ACE2 residue 354, at the boundary of the SARS-CoV binding site, whose alteration markedly inhibited utilization by the HCoV-NL63 but not SARS-CoV S proteins.

During in vivo passage of SARS-CoV, a single amino acid substitution was introduced within the binding domain of the viral spike protein recognizing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is known as a SARS-CoV receptor.

Here we identify a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), isolated from SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-permissive Vero E6 cells, that efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein.

SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into human host cells, and ACE2 levels in target cells may influence SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70 %) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25 %) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2.

To provide data support for the study of pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 at the molecular level, and provide suitable candidate targets for vaccine, antibody and drug research and development through comparative analysis for structural characteristics and epitopes of S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

Much progress in understanding the SARS-CoV-2 and molecular details of its life cycle followed by the identification of new therapeutic targets are needed to lead us to an efficient approach in anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug discovery.

Targeted therapy strategies against SARS-CoV-2 cell entry mechanisms fall into four main categories: strategies targeting virus receptors on the host, strategies neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, strategies targeting virus fusion to host cells, and strategies targeting endosomal and non-endosomal dependent pathways of virus entry.

Since SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike (S) protein for entry to the host cell, it is one of the most preferred targets for making vaccines or therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2.

To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, of SARS-CoV-2.

To rapidly evaluate in\240\vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2.

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) on spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the main region interacting with the viral receptor-ACE2 and is a useful target for induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV infection.

Finally, ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, and TMPRSS2 were found to be coexpressed by type II pneumocytes, which represent important viral target cells, suggesting that SARS S is cleaved by TMPRSS2 in the lung of SARS-CoV-infected individuals.

Identification of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as an obligate cellular receptor for SARS-CoV contributed to understanding of the SARS-CoV entry process, and helped to characterize two targets of antiviral therapeutics: the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2.

Here we demonstrate that SARS-CoV mainly utilizes the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway for its entry to target cells by using infectious SARS-CoV, as well as a SARS-CoV pseudovirus packaged in the SARS-CoV envelope.

SARS-CoV S protein and its RNA were only detected in ACE2+ cells in the lungs and other organs, indicating that ACE2-expressing cells are the primary targets for SARS-CoV infection in vivo in humans.

We demonstrate that a potent SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitor GRL0617 is highly effective in inhibiting protease activity of SARS-CoV-2 with the IC50 of 2.2 ±0.

In addition, we confirmed USF1 as a substrate of human PAS kinase (hPASK) in vitro Combined, our data supports a model in which Cbf1/USF1 functions to partition glucose toward respiration and away from lipid biogenesis, while PAS kinase inhibits respiration in part through the inhibition of Cbf1/USF1.

USF1 mRNA levels were increased in mouse kidneys with carbohydrate refeeding, and USF1 protein was increased in diabetic rat kidneys compared with controls.

Although the anti-HLA antibodies produced were specific for HLA-A2, the boosting of anti-HLA-A2 IgG production did not require the expression of the HLA-A2 protein, since either HLA-A2-negative skin xenografts or HLA-identical x-irradiated PBLs enhanced the production of anti-HLA-A2 IgG.

Stimulation of HLA-A expression by IFN-gamma requires nuclear export of HLA-A mRNA by chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM-1).

We next addressed the question of whether ubiquitination is a condition for the retrograde movement of MHC class I molecules from the ER to the cytosol, or whether ubiquitination is merely required for recognition of dislocated MHC class I molecules by the proteasome.

High affinity peptides can apparently compete with peptides in preloaded MHC class I molecules at the cell surface, whereas low affinity peptides require empty MHC molecules within cells.

We found that, in the absence of exogenous peptides, the HLA-Cw,0304 transfectants were killed at levels comparable to untransfected RMA-S cells whereas protection from lysis required both HLA-Cw,0304 heavy chain expression and an exogenously added HLA-Cw,0304-binding peptide.

Like all others MHC-I molecules, HLA-C requires β2-microglobulin (β2m) for appropriate folding and expression on the cell membrane but this association is weaker, thus generating HLA-C free-chains on the cell surface.

We show that maintaining the fast-to-slow MHC isoform shift required consistent aerobic training in the soleus and plantaris muscles: detraining clearly abolished any fast-to-slow gains in the plantaris, whereas the training volume in DETR Hi rats appeared to influence the MHC return to basal levels in the soleus.

In HLA-B,27:05, the metals triggered conformational reorientations of pVIPR, but no such structural changes were observed in the HLA-B,27:09 subtype, with or without bound metal ion.

This conclusion was further substantiated by the finding that expression of viral genes known to interfere with MHC class I expression, such as the TAP inhibitor ICP47 of HSV and the MHC class I-destroying US11 protein of HCMV, was sufficient to trigger the cytotoxicity of NK cell clones expressing an inhibitory KIR for HLA-C.

A variant upstream of human leukocyte antigen C (HLA-C) shows the most significant genome-wide effect on HIV control in European Americans and is also associated with the level of HLA-C expression.

The frequency distribution of HLA-A,02 alleles (OR 9.719, OR 95 % CI 4.377-21.58, P = 0.0) and HLA-B,07 (OR 11.605, OR 95 % CI 2.397-56.191, P = 0.001) in the Eales disease group was higher than in the normal control group, but the HLA-A,11 alleles (OR 0.495, OR 95 % CI 0.245-1.0, P = 0.048) were lower than in the normal control group, showing a significant difference.

The frequencies of KIR2DL1 ligand (HLA-C2) and KIR3DL1 ligand (HLA-B Bw4-80I) in the CML group were significantly lower than that of the control group, suggesting that the HLA-C2 and HLA-B Bw4-80I expression is probably decreased in the CML patient group, which led to reduced inhibitory signal and enhanced activating signal of KIR2DL1+ and/or KIR3DL1+ NK cells.

To characterize RFLP in psoriasis patients who did not have HLA-Cw6, 12 patients and 10 healthy controls who had HLA-Cw7 were also examined.

The frequencies of antigens HLA-A and-C and the majority of HLA-B phenotypes were not significantly different between the patient and control groups, whereas the antigen frequency of HLA-B16 was increased significantly (P less than 0.025) in the patient group.

To investigate the influence of KIR and HLA-C ligands on the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), we studied 200 patients who were confirmed to have PTB and 200 healthy controls on the different frequencies of KIR and HLA-C ligands.

HLA-C alleles that bear substitutions in the microRNA binding site are more expressed at the cell surface and associated with the control of HIV-1 viral load, suggesting a role of HLA-C in the presentation of antigenic peptides to CTLs.

We show that the-35 C allele is a proxy for high HLA-C cell surface expression, and that individuals with high-expressing HLA-C alleles progress more slowly to AIDS and control viremia significantly better than individuals with low HLA-C expressing alleles.

KIR genotype distributions and HLA-C allele frequencies were compared in patients and controls and among patients with and without HLA-B27 positivity, early age onset and spinal syndesmophytes.

To further define the role of indirect allorecognition, cardiac allografts from HLA-A2-transgenic (HLA-A2+) C57BL/6 mice were heterotopically transplanted into normal C57BL/6, CD4 T cell-knockout (KO) C57BL/6 mice, CD8 T cell-KO C57BL/6 mice, fully MHC-discordant BALB/c mice (allogeneic control), and HLA-A2+ C57BL/6 mice (syngeneic control).

We adoptively transferred HLA-A2-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from type 1 diabetic patients and nondiabetic control subjects into transgenic NOD-scid/γc(null)/HLA-A,0201 (NOD-scid/γc(null)/A2) mice.

The potential contribution of HLA-A alleles to viremic control in chronic HIV type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been relatively understudied compared with HLA-B.

In common with HLA-B alleles that are associated with effective control of viremia, HLA-A,7401 presents highly targeted epitopes in several proteins, including Gag, Pol, Rev, and Nef, of which the Gag epitopes appear immunodominant.

In common with HLA-B alleles linked with slow progression, viremic control through an HLA-A,7401-restricted response appears to be associated with the selection of escape mutants within Gag epitopes that reduce viral replicative capacity.

These studies highlight the potentially important contribution of an HLA-A allele to immune control of HIV infection, which may have been concealed by a stronger effect mediated by an HLA-B allele with which it is in linkage disequilibrium.

Thus, while high HLA-C expression may generally facilitate control of HIV-1, Nef may counteract HLA-C-mediated immune control in some individuals indirectly, by manipulating T-cell function and MHC-II antigen presentation.

These results suggest that the capability of HLA-C-licensed NK cells to control HIV-1 replication is determined by the strength of KIR/HLA-C interactions and is thus dependent on both host genetics and the extent of virus-mediated HLA-C downregulation.

Surprisingly, the percentage of TNFalpha+ T cells was also significantly lower in healthy HLA-B27 positive controls (median 7.48 %) than in healthy HLA-B27 negative controls (p=0.

Furthermore, the percentage of IFNgamma+ T cells was lower in patients with AS and in healthy HLA-B27 positive controls than in healthy HLA-B27 negative controls (p=0.

The lower T cell production of TNFalpha and IFNgamma shown at the single cell level in HLA-B27 positive patients with AS and healthy HLA-B27 positive controls may contribute to the increased susceptibility of HLA-B27 positive subjects to develop AS.

HLA-B21, Cw6 and DR53 were increased significantly in patients compared to controls (P = 1.0e-5, 1.0e-5 and P = 0.0053 respectively) while HLA-A19, DR52, were significantly decreased (P = 0.00236, 0.05, respectively).

HLA-B,27-restricted and HLA-B,57-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) play a key role in controlling HIV-1 in Caucasians and Africans, whereas it is unclear which CTLs control HIV-1 in Asian countries, where HLA-B,57 and HLA-B,27 are very rare.

The capability of HLA-C and HLA-E to control NK cell killing of HIV-infected autologous T cells coated with anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody was determined by blocking the interaction between the inhibitory receptors on NK cells and the MHC class I molecules on infected cells.

Our analyses in persons of European descent, the largest ethnic group examined, show that the effect of HLA-B alleles on HIV-1 control correlates with the binding strength between corresponding HLA-B allotypes and LILRB2 (p = 10 (- 2)).

Expression of CD137 was monitored on CD8(+) T cells after brief stimulation with the H-Y peptides in FtoM HLA-A0201 HCT recipients (N=29), and control groups (HLA-A0201 MtoM [ N=18], non-HLA-A0201 FtoM [ N=14], and HLA-A0201 female volunteers [ N=25]).

Although one of these epitopes almost exactly overlaps an HLA-B,57-restricted epitope in Gag linked with immune control of HIV, this HLA-A,68:02-restricted Gag-TA10 response imposed only weak selection pressure on the virus and was not associated with significantly lower viral setpoint.

We propose that the relative resistance to Nef-mediated down-regulation by the cytoplasmic domains of HLA-B compared with HLA-A contributes to the better control of HIV-1 infection associated with HLA-B-restricted CTLs.

Among 36 HLA-A2(+) children with diabetes, 29 responded to ZnT8 epitopes, whereas only 3 of 16 HLA-A2(+) control patients and 0 of 17 HLA-A2(-) control patients responded.

The observed association between HLA-B,13 and control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection has been linked to the number of Gag-specific HLA-B,13-restricted cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) responses identified.

We describe an overrepresentation of the HLA-B8 allele (28.44 %) in cervical cancer patients as compared to the MHC class I allele frequency in a local healthy control population (18.8 %) and the identification of an HLA-B8-binding peptide TLHEYMLDL (HPV16 E7(7-15)), which is able to drive HPV16 E7-specific and MHC class I-restricted T-cell responses in peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals.

Phylogenetic comparisons revealed that the chimpanzee restriction elements, Patr-B,02and-B,03, described here do not show any obvious similarity with the HLA-B,27 and-B,57 alleles, suggesting that CTL responses to HIV-1 in distinct primate species may be controlled by different types of HLA-B-like molecules.

The hTRIM5α sensitivity of viruses from both HLA-B,57-positive (HLA-B,57(+)) and HLA-B,27(+) patients who spontaneously controlled viral replication, but not viruses from viremic patients expressing these alleles, was significantly greater than that of viruses from patients not expressing these protective HLA-B alleles.

Analysis of variable amino acid positions demonstrates that HLA-B position 97 is the most significant association with host control in African Americans (omnibus P = 1.2 × 10 (- 21)) and explains the signal of several HLA-B alleles, including B,57:03.

The MHC class I molecule Mamu-B,17 has been associated with elite control of SIV infection in rhesus macaques, akin to the protective effects described for HLA-B,57 in HIV-infected individuals.

HLA-B57/5801 drives a preferential CD27(+) differentiation of central memory CD8(+) T cells directed against HIV-Gag but not Nef that may contribute to the ability of Gag-specific CD8(+) T cells to better control HIV in HLA-B57/5801 nonprogressors.

The association between HLA-B 2705 and the immune control of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has previously been linked to the targeting of the HLA-B 2705-restricted Gag epitope KRWIILGLNK (KK10) by CD8(+) T cells.

The HLA-B,5101(+) hemophiliacs whose HIV-1 replication had been controlled for approximately 25 years had HIV-1 possessing the wild-type Pol283-8 sequence or the Pol283-8V mutant, which does not critically affect T-cell recognition, whereas other HLA-B,5101(+) hemophiliacs had HIV-1 with escape mutations in this epitope.

We found that expression of HLA-B57 was associated with exceptional control of HIV during infancy, even when mutations within TW10 and most other B57-restricted epitopes were transmitted, subverting the natural immunodominance of HLA-B57.

These data suggest that the length limitation of naturally processed MHC class I-associated peptides is primarily controlled by peptide availability after antigen processing rather than the binding specificity of MHC class I molecules.

Finally, we show that HLA-B,14:02 is significantly more strongly associated with viremic control than HLA-B,14:01.

These studies demonstrate a surprisingly strong and systemically dominant effect of skeletal muscle MHC expression on maintaining T cell function and pathogen control and argue that the normally low MHC I expression in skeletal muscle is host protective by allowing for pathogen control while preventing immune exhaustion.

Interestingly, a counter selection was observed against the expression of MICA/B in HSP70-overexpressing tumors compared with control tumors in SCID, but not in SCID/beige mice, suggesting a functional relevance of MICA/B expression.

Furthermore, the microsatellite allele consisting of 6 repetitions of GCT/AGC (MICA A6 allele) was present at a significantly higher frequency in the BD patient group than in the control group and a significant fraction of B51-negative patients were positive for this MICA A6 allele.

We found a higher frequency of MICA-129 val/val genotype in patients than in controls (corrected p value = 0.02) that could suggest a tumor escape mechanism because of failure to activate NK cells by MICA-129 val allele or absence of NK cell activation because of absence of MICA-129 met allele in individuals otherwise predisposed to viral/environmental factors.

To investigate the association of MICA with BD, we studied the MICA polymorphism in 108 Korean BD patients and 204 healthy controls in relation to the presence of HLA-B51 and clinical manifestations.

No significant difference between HLA-B27+ patients with AS and healthy controls was found: the MICA-A4 allele was present in more than 90 % of subjects.

On the other hand, in the multibacillary (MB) patients significantly decreased allele frequencies of HLA-B46 (0.04 in MB patients vs 0.129 in controls) and MICA-A5 (0.2 vs 0.38) were observed compared with the healthy controls.

MICA genotyping data in 81 Japanese patients with Takayasu\s arteritis, 38 Japanese patients with Buerger\s disease, and 160 healthy Japanese controls showed that MICA-1.

In order to investigate the influence of the MICB gene, located about 120 kb centromeric of the HLA-B gene, on the susceptibility to BD, (CA/TG) dinucleotide repeat microsatellite polymorphism in intron 1 of the MICB gene was investigated among 77 Japanese patients with BD, 60 randomly selected controls and 28 HLA-B51-positive unrelated healthy controls.

Seventeen HLA-B27-positive Japanese patients with HLA-B27 AAU, 51 Japanese controls, and 20 B27-positive Japanese controls were examined for MICA gene polymorphism within the transmembrane region using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent automated fragment detection by fluorescent-based technology.

The results of our study emphasize the clinical importance of the MICA/NKG2D axis in CMV control in KTx and point out that the potential MICA transcription in the donor allograft is of clinically relevant importance for CMV immune control in this allogeneic situation.

To explore the association of MICA and MICB polymorphisms with RA in a Han Chinese population in Hainan Island, samples from 172 RA and 137 healthy controls were genotyped for MICA and MICB.

Our results indicated that MICB,002 and MICB,014 were less frequent in RA patients than in controls (P = 0.0, 0.005) while there were higher percentages of RA patients carrying MICA,009 and MICA,A6 (P = 0.005).

Despite the wide range of potential therapeutic applications of MICA manipulation, the factors that control MICA expression are unclear.

The association of three SNPs in the MHC region previously identified as the most associated in high-density genotyping studies was tested in a case-control study on 973 BD patients and 825 controls from Iran, and the association of HLA-B alleles was tested in a subset of 681 patients and 414 controls.

In contrast the continued expression of human MHC antigens in heterokaryons suggests that embryonal carcinoma cells either are devoid of or contain only a very limited amount of trans-acting factors controlling the expression of MHC antigens.

CTL specific for HLA-A2/gag efficiently lysed complex-targeted cells, while control CTL (specific for an HLA-A2.

We show that the-335 to ATG region of the HLA-A11 gene promoter is inactive in JEG-3 and BeWo cells while able to control efficient reporter gene transcription in other cell types, indicating that this region is the target for downregulation of HLA-A expression in choriocarcinoma cell lines.

The identification of TAPBPR as an additional component of the MHC class I antigen-presentation pathway demonstrates that mechanisms controlling MHC class I expression remain incompletely understood.

The frequency of HLA-A29 and HLA-DR9 antigens is higher in T1D with DR compared to T1D without DR and to controls with frequencies of HLA-A29 (59.26 % vs.

Our previous study of polymorphisms in the HLA-class I genes of 71 Japanese SJS/TEN patients with ocular surface complications and 113 Japanese healthy controls showed that in the Japanese, HLA-A,0206 was strongly associated with SJS/ TEN.

Our study reveals that the renowned MHC polymorphism also manifests as transcript diversity, and our novel haplotype-based approach marks a new step toward identification of regulatory variants involved in the control of MHC-associated phenotypes and diseases.

Therefore, we compared and orthogonally validated quantitation of peptide:MHC complexes by radioimmunoassay and flow cytometry using TCR mimic antibodies in three model systems to establish a method to control the experimental input of peptide MHC:complexes for MS analysis.

The Han-MHC database was selected as a population control for HLA-B analysis.

Therefore, other MHC regulators must be present to control HLA-C, HLA-E, and HLA-G expression in these cells.

The loading of peptide Ags onto MHC class I molecules is a highly controlled process in which the MHC class I-dedicated chaperone tapasin is a key player.

In humans, the classical antigen presentation function of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules is controlled by the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C loci.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites in the MHC were used to map segments of the 8.1 ancestral haplotype carried by type I diabetic and control subjects expressing either HLA-B8 or DR3, but not both these markers.

Molecular subtyping of B,51x revealed HLA-B,51011 and B,5108 as the predominant suballeles in both patient groups and controls although with a slightly increased frequency of HLA-B,5108 in the diseased individuals.

Linkage analysis of HLA haplotypes, HLA-B27 subtypes, and a 9.2-kb PvuII B7 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) (shown previously to be associated with peripheral arthritis in ankylosing spondylitis [ AS]) in 115 relatives from 12 multiplex spondyloarthropathy (SNSA) and 2 B27-positive control families showed AS to be linked to HLA-B27 haplotypes.

The class II region of the human major histocompatibility complex (MHC) may encode several genes controlling the processing of endogenous antigen and the presentation of peptide epitopes by MHC class I molecules to cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

Cold target inhibition of cytolysis mediated by these lines indicated that a shared or cross-reactive MHC controlled restriction element other than the known MHC determinants was retained by the EBV-LCL variants.

We aimed to assess the mRNA expression of MHC class 1-related molecules in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients vs healthy controls (HCs) and, subsequently, if the absence of HLA-C,07 is associated with genetic susceptibility to axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA).

Here, we analyze MHC genetic variation among 26, 44 lung cancer patients and 20, 836 controls densely genotyped across the MHC, using the Illumina Illumina OncoArray or Illumina 660 W SNP microarray.

We thus sequenced the entire 5-Mb MHC region in 20, 635 individuals of Han Chinese ancestry (10, 689 controls and 9, 946 patients with psoriasis) and constructed a Han-MHC database that includes both variants and HLA gene typing results of high accuracy.

Univariate analysis revealed that cases were more likely to be carriers of HLA-C,01,-C,02,-C,06,-C,12,-B,27,-B,38 and-B,57, whereas controls were more likely to be carriers of HLA-C,03,-C,07,-B,07,-B,51,-DRB1,15 and-DQB1,0602.

This maturation is associated with an increase in lytic activity, as well as an increase in HLA-C protein levels controlled by the NK-specific HLA-C promoter, NK-Pro.

We propose that modulation of the translatability of HLA-C transcripts in NK cells constitutes an evolutionary mechanism to control cis inhibitory signaling by HLA-C, which fine tunes NK cell activity.

Individuals with HLA-C variants with a predominance of immunologically active conformations would display stronger immunity to HIV-1, reduced viral infectivity and effective control of HIV-1 infection, while subjects with HLA-C variants that easily dissociate from β2 microglobulin/peptide would have a reduced immunological response to HIV-1 and produce more infectious virions.

To map specific MHC region variants associated with PBC in a Han Chinese cohort, we imputed HLA antigens and amino acids (AA) in 1126 PBC cases and 1770 healthy control subjects using a Han-MHC reference database.

We characterized evolutionary relationships of representative immune genes (Mhc1 and Tlr2b) and a control gene (ubiquitin, Ubb), using a relatively large and phylogenetically diverse set of species with complete coding sequences (34 orthologous loci for Mhc1, 29 for Tlr2b, and 37 for Ubb).

Our data expand the knowledge about MHC class I regulation and showed for the first time an miRNA-dependent control of MHC class I antigens mediated by the CDS.

Previous studies have shown that the class II MHC transactivator (CIITA), a master regulator that controls class II MHC expression, is targeted by TGF-beta for repression of IFN-gamma-induced class II MHC expression in astrocytes.

Trophoblast cells from all SCNT pregnancies expressed MHC-I, while trophoblast cells from age-matched control pregnancies were negative for MHC-I expression.

The expression of MHC-II, which is controlled mainly at the level of transcription, is strictly dependent upon the binding of the class II transactivator (CIITA) to the highly conserved promoters of all MHC-II genes.

The spontaneous control of human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV) is typically associated with specific major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles and efficient CD8(+) T-cell responses, but many controllers maintain viral control despite a nonprotective MHC background and weak CD8(+) T-cell responses.

We show that the promoter IV (pIV) of class II transactivator (CIITA), the master regulator of MHCII expression controls endogenous MHCII expression by LNSCs.

Although the endocytic route leading to MHC-II presentation is characterized to a large extent, the mechanisms controlling DC-SIGN targeted cross-presentation of exogenous peptides on MHC-I, are not completely resolved yet.

We further studied CD8-/-, MHC I-/- and wild type control (WT) C57BL/6J mice to determine the importance of CD8+ T cells and MHC I molecules.

Knowledge of macaque MHC has substantially improved their utility for modeling HIV and could aid in modeling other viruses as well, both in the context of distribution of alleles across treatment groups in vaccine trials and in deciphering mechanisms of immune control of pathogens for which specific MHC alleles demonstrate differential impacts on disease.

Overall, our results suggest that certain protective MHC-I alleles allow superior control of HIV-1 by targeting epitopes where mutations typically incur high fitness costs and small reductions in MHC-I binding affinity.

Association of MHC-I genotypes with HIV/SIV control has been investigated at MHC-I allele levels but not fully at haplotype levels.

In view of this apparent association of HLA-A,1101 with resistance to acquisition of HIV-1 infection, and given the importance of eliciting strong CTL responses to control and eliminate HIV-1, we have determined the crystal structure of HLA-A,1101 complexed with two immunodominant HIV-1 CTL epitopes: the nonamer reverse transcriptase(313-321) (AIFQSSMTK) and decamer Nef(73-82) (QVPLRPMTYK) peptides.

It is speculated that HLA-A(,) 26-restricted HIV-1-specific CTLs can control HIV-1, since HLA-A(,) 26 is associated with a slow progression to AIDS.

Peptide-stimulated cultures were also set up from 8 known seropositive donors with HLA-B35 or B53, and from a control group of volunteers at low-risk of HIV infection with HLA-B35 (12 Gambian and 7 European) and 2 Gambians with HLA-B53.

In addition, HLA-B57 was associated with a lower HCV viral load in the control group and HIV controllers, and conversely, HLA-B35 with higher HCV viral load in HIV controllers.

The HLA-Cw,0303+ B-LCL PAJ and control HLA-Cw3-negative cells B-LCL HAJ and T-LCL 500/C9 were used.

We demonstrate that human MHC with control of HIV-1 viral load share binding motifs with chimpanzee MHC.

To block TCR engagement, Tg mouse strains with monoclonal TCR of irrelevant peptide/MHC specificities, all on MAIDS-susceptible genetic backgrounds, were tested: the study of a panel of TCR Tg CD4 T cells controlled for the possibility of serendipitous crossreactive recognition of virus-associated or induced-self peptide, or superantigen, MHC complexes by a given TCR.

In particular we found variation within the OAS1 (meta-OR = 0.83, 95 % CI: 0.69-1.0) and CCR5 (meta-OR = 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.08-1.53) genes is significantly associated with West Nile virus disease, while variation within MICB (meta-OR = 2.35, 95 % CI: 1.68-3.29), PLCE1 (meta-OR = 0.55, 95 % CI: 0.42-0.71), MBL2 (meta-OR = 1.54, 95 % CI: 1.02-2.31), and IFN-γ (meta-OR = 2.48, 95 % CI: 1.3-4.71), is associated with dengue disease.

The well-known CCR5Δ32 del32 allele, the cell death-related TNF-α-238 A and PDCD1-7209 T alleles, and HCP5 rs2395029 G, a non-coding protein associated with the HLA-B,5701, were found positively associated with the LTNP condition.

Except for the HLA-B,27:05 allele, other genetic markers were associated with slower progression: CCR5wt/Δ32 (P=.

Finally, the HLA-C genotype was related to the risk of metastasis-related death in patients with uveal melanoma: The patients carrying HLA-C alleles encoding ligands for KIR2DL1 and KIR2DL2/3 (HLA-C group 1/group 2 heterozygous patients), both inhibitory NK receptors, had a longer metastasis-free survival than did those carrying HLA-C ligands for either KIR2DL1 (HLA-C group 2 homozygotes) or KIR2DL2/3 (HLA-C group 1 homozygotes).

Thus, mutations which either reduced the stability of MicA-PO(4) or abolished kinase activity in MicB were related to competence derepression under microaerobiosis, suggesting that MicA-PO(4) is involved in competence repression when oxygen becomes limiting.

We examined a sample of 95 type I psoriasis patients and 104 Spanish matched controls to investigate whether HLA-Cw,0602 or other closely related class I loci, such as HLA-B and MICA (which are centromeric to HLA-C), or corneodesmosin gene and octamer transcription factor-3 genes (which are telomeric to HLA-C), might play a part in disease development.

This finding suggests that an association between MICA-A6 and BD may be a secondary phenomenon related to HLA-B51.

Typically, a common MICA allele has strong LD with several HLA-B alleles, whereas most HLA-B alleles and their related serological groups are associated with a single MICA allele.

MICA and MICB (MHC class I-related chain A and B) are polymorphic genes that encode molecules related to MHC class I and are expressed on epithelial cells in response to stress.

The Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I chain related (MIC) A and B genes are important additional loci within the MHC.

Our results suggest that the MICA 5.1 allele might be a genetic marker related to the early onset of psoriasis and play a secondary role to the HLA-Cw,0602 gene or an unknown causative gene closely linked to HLA-Cw,0602 in the genetic susceptibility to psoriasis.

In this paper we analyze the two regions of about 385 kb and confirm, giving a new line of evidence, that the following two pairs of the genomic segments were duplicated in evolution: (i) a 43-kb genomic segment including the HLA-B gene showing the highest polymorphism among the classical HLA class I loci (class Ia) and a 40-kb segment including the HLA-C locus showing the lowest polymorphism and (ii) a 52-kb segment including the MIC (MHC class I chain related gene) B and a 35-kb segment including MICA.

MICA and the closely related MICB were recognized by intestinal epithelial T cells expressing diverse Vdelta1 gammadelta TCRs.

Non-HLA MHC alleles have also been implicated, although many such studies have been inconsistent, likely due to power issues related to the low number of HLA-B27-negative AS patients examined.

The association between HLA-B27 and spondyloarthropathy may be related to antigen-presenting specificity, but a different mechanism, presentation of a B27-derived peptide by class II antigens, may contribute to the pathogenesis of acute anterior uveitis, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive understanding of the structure, antigenicity, and function of HLA-B27.

The Second International Simmons Center Conference on HLA-B27-Related Disorders presented a number of new observations related to the molecular biology of the HLA-B27 molecule, its functional biology as a peptide-binding molecule, and the clinical implications of the association of B27 with the spondylarthropathies, as well as new clinical information concerning these diseases.

Bioinformatic analysis of the MHC side chains observed to contribute to the peptide anchor specificity, and other specific peptide contacts, reveals HLA alleles associated with long-term nonprogression and a number of related HLA alleles that may share overlapping peptide repertoires with HLA-B,5703 and thus may display a similar capacity for efficient immune control of HIV-1 infection.

Although this novel allele was added to the HLA-B,55 family by the Nomenclature Committee, the next related alleles were found in the HLA-B,56 group.

Because most of the non-B,27 MHC-I molecules associated with AS risk bind a relatively high percentage of peptides with N-terminal basic residues, we hypothesize that the non-epistatic association of ERAP2 with AS might be related to the processing of peptides with these residues, thus affecting the peptidomes of AS-associated MHC-I molecules.

The functional interaction between ERAP1 and HLA-B27 or other MHC-I molecules may be related to the processing of specific epitopes, or to a more general peptide-dependent influence on other biological features of the MHC-I proteins.

The presence of a true susceptibility gene in the vicinity of HLA-B,51 has also been extensively investigated because of the limited evidence that directly relates HLA-B,51 to the pathogenesis of BD.

HLA-B-restricted epitopes also induced responses of higher magnitude than did either HLA-A- or HLA-C-restricted epitopes, although this comparison only reached statistical significance for EBV epitopes.

Due to genetic differences at population level, drug hypersensitivity reactions are varied, and thus common pharmacogenetics markers for one country might be different from another country, for instance, HLA-A,31:01 is associated with carbamazepine (CBZ)-induced SCARs in European and Japanese while HLA-B,15:02 is associated with CBZ-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) among Taiwanese and Southeast Asian.

In contrast to mHER-2(9(435)), vaccination of HLA-A,0201 transgenic (HHD) mice with hHER-2(9(435)) significantly increased the frequency of mHER-2(9(435))-specific CTL and also induced strong protective and therapeutic immunity against the transplantable ALC tumor cell line transfected to coexpress HLA-A,0201 and hHER-2/neu or rHER-2/neu.

Among four different PTHrP peptides carrying the HLA-A24 binding motif, both the PTHrP(36-44) and PTHrP(102-111) peptides efficiently induced peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A24(+) prostate cancer patients.

Seven peptides possessing the ability to induce HLA-A31-restricted and tumor-reactive CTLs were examined for their ability to induce HLA-A3-,-A11-, and-A33-restricted and tumor-reactive CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 18 epithelial cancer patients.

One RLI- or KIAA0036-derived peptide induced tumor-reactive CTLs in PBMCs of HLA-A3(+) and-A11(+) or HLA-A11(+) and-A33(+) cancer patients also with various frequencies (22-67 %), respectively, whereas the other peptide induced CTL activity in only HLA-A33(+) patients.

We identified a novel HLA-A24-restricted NY-ESO-1-derived epitope peptide (LLMWITQCF) that could induce specific CTLs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HLA-A24(+) healthy donors.

This study aimed to identify HLA-A2(+) immunogenic peptides from the CS1 antigen, which induce peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HLA-A2(+) MM cells.

Four out of the twenty-five 9-mer peptides tested: peptides 3 (F33-41), 13 (F214-222), 14 (F273-281), and 23 (F559-567), were found to bind to HLA-A,0201 with moderate to high affinity and were capable of inducing IFN-γ and IL-2 secretion in lymphocytes from HLA-A,0201 transgenic (HLA-Tg) mice pre-immunized with RSV or recombinant adenovirus expressing RSV F.

To facilitate the development of a peptide-based cancer vaccine for prostate cancer patients, we examined whether any of the 13 peptides previously reported to induce HLA-class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in HLA-A3 supertype (- A3,-A11,-A31 and-A33)-positive prostate cancer patients are also capable of inducing CTLs restricted to HLA-A2, HLA-A24 or HLA-A26 alleles.

Among the 13 peptides tested, a peptide at positions 309 to 318 of β-tubulin 5 exhibited binding activity to the HLA-A(,) 2402 molecule and induced HLA-A24-restricted CTL activity against prostate cancer cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of prostate cancer patients.

In addition, one peptide with HLA-A24-binding activity could bind to HLA-A,2601 and induced HLA-A26-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes from HLA-A,2601-,-A,2602-, or-A,2603-positive prostate cancer patients against HLA-A,2603-positive cancer cells.

The identified immunogenic HLA-A24-specific XBP1 unspliced (UN) 185-193 (I S P W I L A V L), XBP1 spliced (SP) 223-231 (V Y P E G P S S L), CD138265-273 (I F A V C L V G F) and CS1240-248 (L F V L G L F L W) peptides induced antigen-specific CTL with anti-MM activity in an HLA-A24 restricted manner.

In this study, we focused on HLA-B,57:01 and abacavir (ABC)-induced immune-mediated IDT, and constructed transgenic mice carrying chimeric HLA-B,57:01 (B,57:01-Tg) to determine if this in vivo model may be useful for evaluating immune-mediated IDT.

P15 could significantly enhance the expression of HLA-A,0201 molecules on the T2 cell surface, stimulate IFN-gamma-producing CTLs from the PBMCs of former SARS patients, and induce specific CTLs from P15-immunized HLA-A2.

In an autologous setting, the HLA-A2+ ihv-DCs that present hTERT antigen prime autologous T cells to generate hTERT-specific CTLs inducing cytolysis of hTERT-expressing target cells in an HLA-A2-restricted manner.

The ihv-DCs, which are engineered to express MAGEA3 and high levels of 4-1 BBL and MICA induce simultaneous production of both HLA-A2-restricted, MAGEA3-specific CTLs and NK cells from HLA-A2+ donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

In addition to the HLA antigens, which elicit a strong immune response against allografted organs, the MICA antigens may be recognized as foreign and induce the production of MICA-specific antibodies.

Cytolysis was triggered by NKG2D recognition of stress-inducible class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-like ligands on macrophages: high doses of LPS induced transcription and surface expression of ULBP1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 and surface expression of constitutively transcribed MICA.

These data suggested that immunization against mismatched MICA alleles induces development of anti-MICA antibodies.

To confirm whether human MHC class I chain-related A (MICA) induces the amplification of V delta 1 gamma delta tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in vitro and to identify the cytotoxicity of MICA-reactive V delta 1 gamma delta TILs towards epithelial tumor cells.

Alternatively, MHC class I-related chain A and B (MICA/B), ligands for NKG2D activating receptor, were found to be induced on DCs upon IFN-alpha stimulation and to be responsible for the NK activation because mAb-mediated masking of MICA/B as well as inhibition of direct cell-to-cell contact using transwell insert completely abolished DC-dependent NK cell activation by IFN-alpha.

In addition to the human leukocyte antigen antigens, which elicit a strong immune response, the polymorphic MICA antigens induce production of MICA antibodies and sMICA.

We recently reported that a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2596542 located in the MICA promoter region was significantly associated with the risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and also with serum levels of soluble MICA (sMICA).

MHC class I polypeptide-related chain A (MICA) molecule is induced in response to viral infection, various types of stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, and ischemia or/and reperfusion, by which MICA was shed from the cell surface into the extracellular domain, generating a soluble form (sMICA).

In conclusion, the activation of NF-κB can up-regulate the expression of MICA and induce the expression of MMP-9, which hydrolyzes MICA into sMICA to promote tumor immune escape.

IR induced an increase in expression of MICA/MICB in MCF7 cells and SFN induced MICA/MICB expression in A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells.

Although lysine at amino acid position 80 (Lys80) and aspartic acid at position 136 (Asp136) were associated negatively with cervical cancer, only MICB carrying Asp136 could induce NK cell killing more efficiently than MICB-Lys80 when the NK cells were blocked by anti-NKG2D.

Since H-2K(d) and HLA-A2402 molecules have similar anchor motifs, the possibility of inducing HER2-specific CTL activity with HER2p780 in HLA-A2402 individuals was examined.

We screened peptides derived from the HPV-16 E7 protein for binding to HLA-A2 and tested their potential to induce specific CTL responses in chimeric HLA-A2/H2-Kb transgenic mice.

Therefore the peptide 86-93, which binds to HLA-A2, is able to induce CTL responses in context of HLA-A2, but the peptide appears not to be processed or presented by HPV type 16 infected cells.

We identified HLA-A,0201-binding peptides and a naturally processed and presented T-cell epitope capable of inducing CYP1B1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in HLA-A2 transgenic mice.

In the present study, the immunogenicity of 9 HLA-A,0201-binding peptides encoded by HPV16 E6 and E7 was analyzed in vivo in HLA-A,0201Kb transgenic mice and in vitro in CTL cultures induced from PBMC of HLA-A,0201+ healthy donors.

1 transgenic mice to identify the HLA-A2 (A,0201)-restricted CDCA1 epitopes recognized by mouse CTL, and we investigated whether these peptides could induce CDCA1-reactive CTLs from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A2-positive donors and a NSCLC patient.

In HLA-A2(+) donors, in vitro stimulation of PBMC with these peptides could induce peptide-reactive CTLs which killed tumor cell lines endogenously expressing both HLA-A2 and CDCA1.

DOM-peptide vaccines, each encoding a different WT1-derived, HLA-A2-restricted epitope induced cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in humanized transgenic mice expressing chimeric HLA-A2, without affecting hematopoietic stem cells.

These peptides actually bound to HLA-A24 in the stabilization assay using T2-A,2402 cells, and induced a strong peptide-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte response in HLA-A24 transgenic mice after vaccination.

Therefore, in this study, human leukocyte antigen A,0201 (HLA-A,0201)-restricted human CTL epitopes of HPV-16 E5 protein were identified using a bioinformatics approach, and the abilities of these predicted peptides to induce an immune response in HLA-A,0201 transgenic mice were confirmed by assaying E5-specific CTLs and in vitro-generated CTLs from normal peripheral blood T lymphocytes of HLA-A2-positive human donors.

Moreover, in vitro incubation of lymphocytes from HLA-A,0201+ healthy donors and HLA-A,0201+CEA+ cancer patients with CEA+/HS-Exo-pulsed autologous dendritic cells induces HLA-A,0201-restricted and CEA-specific CTL response.

A newly identified HER-2(905) peptide epitope is naturally processed and presented as a CTL epitope on HER-2 overexpressing tumor cells, and an MHC anchor-substituted analog, HER-2(905AA), can efficiently induce HER-2-specific, HLA-A24 restricted CTLs.

polystyrene beads loaded with antibodies specific for HLA-A2 and ICAM-1 induced the accumulation of membrane rafts, and beads loaded with ICAM-1-specific antibodies caused the selective recruitment of HLA-A2 MHC-I at the contact area of the target cells.

Moreover, injecting macaques with DNA encoding a specific macaque allogeneic MHC induced anti-allogeneic MHC antibodies production.

These studies show that DNA immunization with MHC-encoding vectors can indeed be used to induce specific anti-human xenogeneic, as well as anti-macaque allogeneic MHC immunity in non-human primates.

In 3 cell lines, expression of some HLA-B alleles could not be induced by IFN-alpha or-gamma: HLA-B44 in cell line 92-1, HLA-B15 in cell line OCM-1 and HLA-B5 in cell line MEL-202.

In OMM-1 cells, IFN-alpha and-gamma increased the expression of HLA-A but did not induce expression of the 2 B alleles, indicating an HLA-B locus-specific loss.

We show that the HLA-A promoter activity cannot be induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and that exogenous MHC class II transactivator CIITA is able to induce HLA class I promoter activity in these cells.

All peptides showed similar affinity for HLA-A11 molecules and were recognized by IVT-specific CTL clones, but induced HLA-A11 complexes at the cell surface with different lifespan.

Although all four HLA allotypes of the MCF-7 cells (HLA-A,02:01, B,18, B,44, and C,5) present peptides of similar lengths and C-termini, which should be processed similarly by the proteasome and by the APP chaperones, the IFNs induced differential modulation of the HLA-A, B, and C peptidomes.

In conclusion, we identified several significant genetic risk factors for the first time in the Spanish Caucasian population: HLA-A,02:01/Cw,15:02 combination as a risk factor for PHT-induced SJS/TEN, HLA-B,38:01 for LTG- and PHT- induced SJS/TEN, HLA-A,11:01 for CBZ-induced SJS/TEN, and HLA-A,24:02 for LTG- and PHT- induced DRESS.

Vitiligo risk associated with the MHC class I region thus derives from combined quantitative and qualitative phenomena: a SNP haplotype in a transcriptional regulator that induces gain-of-function, elevating expression of HLA-A RNA in vivo, in strong linkage disequilibrium with an HLA-A allele that confers, 2 : 1 specificity.

The HLA-B,3501 affinity of peptides correlated with their ability to induce CTL in HLA-B,3501 transgenic mice.

The cytolytic responses of either normal (non transgenic), HLA-B7 (single transgenic) or HLA-B7 x human beta 2 microglobulin (double transgenic) DBA/2 mice induced by transfected HLA-Cw3 P815 (H-2d) mouse mastocytoma cells were compared, to evaluate whether the expression of an HLA class I molecule in responder mice would favor the emergence of HLA-specific, H-2-unrestricted CTL.

Neither free cysteine in solution nor an exposed cysteine on a class II MHC molecule can be alkylated, showing that specific recognition between the anchor side-chain pocket of an MHC class I protein and the designed ligand (propinquity) is necessary to induce the selective covalent reaction with the MHC class I molecule.

Significantly, the formation of HLA-B27 homodimers in transfected KG-1 cells is induced by maturation, with a transient induction also seen in LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived dendritic cells expressing HLA-B27.

The transmission of HIV-1 from mother to child during pregnancy is unlike other types of HIV-1 transmission because the child shares major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes with the mother during a time while the mother is induced to tolerate the paternally derived fetal MHC molecules, in part through natural killer (NK) recognition of MHC polymorphisms.

Key examples have included the associations of HLA-B,15:02 and carbamazepine induced SJS/TEN in Southeast Asian populations and HLA-B,57:01 and abacavir hypersensitivity.

A highly calibrated maturation enables NK cells to eliminate target cells with lowered or absent MHC-I or induced MHC-I-related molecules while maintaining their tolerance toward self-MHC.

During demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), locally elevated cytokine levels may induce upregulation of MHC class II molecules on otherwise low expressing or negative cell types such as microglia and astrocytes, since IFN-gamma has been shown to induce MHC class II expression on these cell types in vitro.

There was little difference in the frequency of total MAITs between healthy donors (HDs) and untreated MS patients, whereas the latter harbored more CD8(lo/neg) (DN) MAITs concomitant with a decrease in CD8(high) MAITs and in CD4 MAITs compared with those in HDs.

Phenotypical analysis of CD45+ CD3+ T cells indicated that the major contributing phenotype to this influx is a CD4 and CD8 double-negative T cell (DNT) subtype, while CD4+ T cells decreased and CD8+ T cells remained unchanged.

The percentage of naive CD4(+) T (0.386) and naive CD8(+) T cells (0.271) were decreased while the percentage of terminally differentiated effector memory CD8(+) T cells (0.377) and transitional B cells (0.223) were increased.

For instance, the mutation V190I in subtype A1-infected individuals is associated with HLA-B,5802 (P = 4.73 x 10 (- 4)), a rapid-progression allele according to other studies, and also to a decreased mean CD4 count (P = 0.019).

MHC II gene knockout C57/BL6 mice, with significantly decreased CD4 T cells, were used.

The inability of NK cells to lyse HIV-infected T-cell blasts is not dependent on the strain of HIV used to infected the CD4+ T cell These studies indicate that despite drastic decreases in MHC class I molecule expression, HIV-infected T-cell blasts can evade destruction by autologous NK cells.

Cytomegalovirus, a beta-herpesvirus, impairs major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II antigen presentation by decreasing MHC expression on the surface of the infected cell, thus enabling infected cells to escape CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte immunosurveillance.

Deletion of MHC II expression in macrophages led to an adipose tissue-specific decrease in the effector/memory CD4(+) T\240\cells, attenuation of\240\CD11c(+) ATM accumulation, and improvement in\240\glucose intolerance by increasing adipose tissue insulin sensitivity.

However, whether introduction of such mutations into CD4 causes decreased binding to MHC and loss of function is yet to be determined.

Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 mutations as well as BCG-vaccination status and a host genetic factor, HLA genotypes might affect the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection or severity of COVID-19.

While a subset of epitopes from earlier betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV (SARS), have been validated experimentally, validation systems are often biased toward specific HLA haplotypes (notably HLA-A,02:01) that only account for a fraction of the haplotypes of individuals affected by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

Among the peptides used in the study, the affinity of peptides from HCoV-229e (H77 and H881) and peptides from SARS-CoV (S978 and S1203) for binding to HLA-A2 was higher than that of other sequences.

Taking the data deposited in the GISAID database, we made predictions using the IEDB analysis resource (TepiTool) to gauge how variants in the SARS-CoV-2 genome may change peptide binding to the most frequent MHC-class I and-II alleles in Africa, Asia and Europe.

such a T-cell epitope-specific response was not observed in HLA-A2(+) healthy donors or in HLA-A2(-) donors who had been infected with SARS-CoV after full recovery.

IL-7 was observed to induce a rapid and dose-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak 1 and Jak 3 and concomitantly, the tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of multiple STAT proteins.

JAKs are cytoplasmic proteins that, following the binding of cytokines to their receptors, transduce the signal by phosphorylating STAT proteins which enter the nuclei and rapidly target gene promoters to regulate gene transcription.

In addition, mutagenesis of the Jak3 promoter has revealed that Sp1 binding sites within a-67 to-85 element and a signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) binding site at position-44 to-53 are critical for activation of Jak3 transcription in murine M1 myeloid leukemia cells stimulated with IL-6.

Treatment with H7 did not affect IL-4R-mediated immediate signaling events such as tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak1, Jak3, insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2, or tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of Stat6.

Here we provide novel evidence that AG-490 potently inhibits the autokinase activity of JAK3 and tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA binding of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 a and 5 b (STAT5a/b).

Besides ligand-induced receptor heterodimerization and contacts of the two IL-4 receptor subunits alpha and gamma with Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK3 a prominent constitutive binding between JAK1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription STAT5 was detected.

Reconstitution of the IL7 receptor signaling complex in 293 T cells showed that JAK3 mutants required receptor binding to mediate downstream STAT5 phosphorylation.

Here, we report that JAK1 is a constitutive TGFβRI binding protein and is absolutely required for phosphorylation of STATs in a SMAD-independent manner within minutes of TGF-β stimulation.

In this study, we first showed that STAT5 physically interacts with Runx1, Runx2 and Runx3 by co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

This meta-analysis demonstrates that the CCR5-Δ32 polymorphism acts as a protective factor in T1D development in Europeans, and a risk factor for BD among HLA-B51 carriers.

The CCR5-delta32 allele was readily detected in 7 samples and did not interfere with detection of HLA-B,5701 while providing an internal amplification control.

TDF inhibited Th1‑associated cytokine interferon‑γ and IL‑12 production and downregulated the expression of Th1 specific transcription factor T‑box 21 in OVA‑stimulated splenocytes.

Overall, these results indicated that TDF attenuates OVA‑induced allergic immune response by suppressing the production of Th2 specific cytokine IL‑4, through inhibiting transcription factor GATA‑3, and suggests that TDF may exhibit the potential to regulate the immune response in allergic diseases.

ETV/TDF combination therapy effectively suppressed replication of this TDF-resistant mutant.

These findings demonstrate that SRY directs a previously unrecognized male-specific mechanism of DA cell death and suggests that suppressing nigral Sry synthesis represents a sex-specific strategy to slow or prevent DA cell loss in PD.

Participants receiving EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF exhibited a more rapid decline in HIV-1 RNA and a greater proportion suppressed viral load to less than 50 copies/ml than participants receiving EFV/FTC/TDF.

Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is effective in suppressing HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in HIV-HBV coinfection although HBV DNA can persist in some individuals on TDF-containing antiretroviral therapy (ART).

This study evaluated the efavirenz (EFV) mid-dose plasma concentration (C12), clinical efficacy, and safety after the switch to a single-tablet regimen containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), lamivudine (3 TC), and 400-mg EFV in virally suppressed HIV-positive Taiwanese who were receiving co-formulated TDF, emtricitabine (FTC), and 600-mg EFV.

These data suggest that the inhibitory quotient (IQ) of TAF is projected to be higher than the IQ of TDF, and that TAF has the potential to inhibit viruses containing TDF resistance in the clinic.

TDF uptake was energy independent but its accumulation followed nonlinear kinetics, and excess unlabeled TDF inhibited radiolabeled TDF uptake in competition studies.

Overall, in the VB assay mimicking the 4-fold-higher intracellular levels of TFV-DP observed clinically with TAF versus TDF, TAF inhibited viral breakthrough of most TAM-containing HIV-1, whereas TDF did not.

Mammalian sex determination is controlled by the antagonistic interactions of two genetic pathways: The SRY-SOX9-FGF9 network promotes testis determination partly by opposing proovarian pathways, while RSPO1/WNT-β-catenin/FOXL2 signals control ovary development by inhibiting SRY-SOX9-FGF9.

Early studies showed that SRY represses such Wnt signaling, but also generated discrepancies on whether only mouse Sry is capable of inhibiting such Wnt signaling and whether both human and mouse SRY proteins are able to interact with beta-catenin, the intracellular messenger responsible for executing the Wnt signals.

Also, we showed that the action of Sry as a transcriptional activator was both necessary and sufficient to inhibit Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, suggesting that the transcriptional targets of Sry are responsible for the inhibition of signaling.

In order to investigate Sry regulation network in the development of male embryo, we inhibited the Sry gene expression by RNAi and then examined expression of other sex-related genes.

Intracellular TDF disposition is regulated by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters and, a reduced transport activity may be implicated in accumulation of TDF into the cells.

FEN and TDF co-exposure also regulated the mRNA of vezf, hsp70, p53, gadd45α, induced the synthesis of ROS and activity of GST, suggesting the synergistic potential of oxidative stress induced by FEN and TDF co-exposure.

Sry transcripts are found in all analyzed male rat tissues including the kidney, while Sox3 transcripts are found only in the brain and testis, suggesting that the primary tissue for renin production (kidney) can only be regulated by SRY and not SOX3.

Hence, SRY determines Sertoli cell fate by repressing ovarian and activating testicular differentiation genes, promotes early Sertoli cells to form testis cord, and then passes on its functions to SOX9, which regulates common targets and activates its own gene regulatory program, beyond SRY actions, in sex determination.

Decreased shuttling limits nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated (activated) SRY, in turn reducing occupancy of DNA sites regulating Sertoli-cell differentiation [ the testis-specific SRY-box 9 (Sox9) enhancer].

Human SRY regulated rat promoters in the same manner as rat Sry, elevating Agt, Ren, and Ace promoter activity while downregulating Ace 2.

Despite the sequence differences between the marsupial and eutherian SRY genes, our functional assay indicates that the marsupial SRY gene regulates SOX9 as a transcription factor in a similar way to the eutherian SRY gene.

Interestingly, we showed that mouse SRY cooperates with SF1 to regulate Fgf9 expression, while human SRY-mediated FGF9 expression is SF1- independent.

Furthermore, Tet2 deficiency diminished Sry expression, indicating that TET2-mediated DNA demethylation regulates Sry expression positively.

These genetic data, together with the finding that Sox9 is upregulated in Sertoli cell precursors just after SRY expression begins, has led to the proposal that Sox9 could be directly regulated by SRY.

Our results suggested that the Wt1 transcription was regulated by Sry, whereas the Sox9 expression is not directly regulated by Sry in the development of genital ridge.

Although the interactions of several genes with Sry expression have been suggested, the exact cascade of gene expression regulating Sry transcription is entirely obscure because there is no available cell line expressing Sry and reflecting an in vivo condition.

This implies that chimeric SRY proteins with SOX HMG domains can bind to and regulate SRY target genes and that potential SRY partner factor interactions are not disrupted by HMG domain substitutions.

The TDA proteins may regulate Sry expression or form complexes with the SRY protein to regulate other genes, or the tda genes may be activated or repressed by the SRY protein.

Finally, by analysing p300 and HDAC3 expression profiles during both human or mouse gonadal development, we suggest that acetylation and deacetylation of SRY may be important mechanisms for regulating SRY activity during mammalian sex determination.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with TDF/FTC significantly reduces the risk for HIV-1 transmission, but, to date, nobody knows if PrEP can still be useful in case of viruses harboring resistances to TDF/FTC or if alternative antiretroviral drugs might be rather proposed in selected cases.

TAF delivers TFV-DP to target cells more efficiently and at lower doses than TDF, thereby substantially reducing systemic exposure to TFV, which results in improved bone and renal safety relative to TDF.

Over a 24 hour period, XX and XY gonadally female mice (lacking Sry) exhibited greater horizontal locomotor activity and reduced food consumption per unit bodyweight than XX and XY gonadally male mice (possessing Sry).

Escherichia coli expression of SRY study showed reduced expression of the mutated protein and gel retardation assay method revealed lowered DNA-binding ability in N65D variant of SRY.

Although many SRY mutations reduce DNA-binding/bending activity, it is not clear how SRY mutations that do not affect interaction with DNA contribute to disease.

Sry expression has been shown to be markedly reduced in transgenic mice harboring a mutant GATA4 protein (a member of the GATA family of transcription factors) disrupted in its ability to interact with its transcriptional partner FOG2, suggesting that GATA4 is involved in SRY gene transcription.

Here, we show that mouse Sry protein binds CaM and that a CaM antagonist reduces CaM binding, nuclear accumulation, and transcriptional activity of Sry in transfected cells.

In the present study, we examined a number of missense mutations in the SRY CaM-NLS from human XY sex-reversed females for the first time, showing that they result in significantly reduced nuclear localization of GFP (green fluorescent protein)-SRY fusion proteins in transfected cells compared with wild-type.

Long-term tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) treatment for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is associated with sustained viral suppression and regression of fibrosis and cirrhosis at year 5 (240 weeks) and no TDF resistance through 6 years (288 weeks).

Although no single predictive genetic marker for the development of TDF-FS was identified, the findings from our study suggest that rare variants in multiple genes involved in the renal handling of tenofovir, and/or renal cell homeostasis, may be associated with increased susceptibility to TDF-FS.

Though the overall risk of TDF associated severe renal toxicity in HBV patients appears to be negligible, both glomerular and tubular function should be monitored in patients exposed to TDF, especially when other renal risk factors or a history of previous exposure to adefovir dipivoxil (ADV) are present.

lower eGFR at baseline was associated with TDF discontinuation for toxicity and PI/r use was associated with isolated stop of TDF (Figure).

The use of an ABC- or TDF-containing regimen was independently associated with tubular dysfunction, but we found no significant differences between these groups, except when TDF was combined with a protease inhibitor.

As TDF scale up progresses, programs need to develop capacity for monitoring and treatment of renal impairment associated with TDF.

A higher eGFR at baseline, a lower eGFR after discontinuation of TDF therapy, and more-prolonged exposure to TDF were associated with an increased risk of incomplete recovery 6 months after discontinuation of TDF therapy.

In order to determine whether oral administration of TDF also increases distribution to sites of viral infection, the plasma and circulating lymphoid cell pharmacokinetics of TFV and its phosphorylated metabolites were assessed following a single oral TDF or subcutaneous TFV administration at doses yielding equivalent plasma exposures to TFV in macaques.

The co-administration of TDF 300 mg once a day with fosamprenavir/ritonavir 1400/200 mg or 1400/100 mg once a day has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of amprenavir and results in non-significant increases of ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting that no dose modification is necessary when combining fosamprenavir/ritonavir with TDF.

Co-administration of some HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an oral prodrug of TFV, has been shown to increase systemic levels of TFV, leading to a hypothesis that PIs may affect tubular secretion of TFV and potentially alter the renal safety of TDF.

Given that TDF is an adenosine analogue, like didanosine, exposure to ribavirin might increase intracellular phosphorylated TDF metabolites, which could result in a higher risk of nephrotoxicity.

Tenofovir (TDF) affects bone health and is widely used in pregnancy but data are limited on the effects of TDF exposure in utero.

Correct regulation of SRY is critical: aberrant timing or level of Sry expression is known to disrupt testis development in mice and we hypothesize that mutations that affect regulation of human SRY may account for some of the many cases of XY gonadal dysgenesis that currently remain unexplained.

While the effect of human SRY on individual genes is often modest, we show that many different genes participating in the renin-angiotensin system can be affected by SRY, apparently in coordinated fashion, to produce more Ang II and less Ang-(1-7).

Since expression of Sry was affected these results suggest that long range position effects have disrupted Sry action.

Although XY females carry SRY mutations in these nuclear localization signals that affect SRY nuclear import in transfected cells, it is not known whether these transport mechanisms are essential for gonadal development and sex determination.

Recovery of renal function after discontinuation of TDF is likely affected by the duration of TDF administration.

In contrast, the increase in HLA-ABC expression by CD8+ lymphocytes was associated with transition from 2 H4+ to 2 H4int status, which suggests that increased HLA-ABC expression occurs at an earlier stage in the acquisition of CD45RO in CD8+ cells than for CD4+ cells.

Inclusion of a CD4(+) Th cell epitope within the SCT did not increase the frequency of SVG9-specific CD8(+) T cells, but did enhance protection against WNV challenge.

In the period of 60 to 120 th day after allo-HSCT, blood CD3+CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) gradually increased and fluctuated in the range of 60 to 90 %, CD3+CD4+ cells fluctuated in the range of 5 to 18 %, and CD4+CD25+ cells accounted for between 3 to 13 %.

The results demonstrated that CaCO3-LNT/H5N1 significantly enhanced the expression of MHC-II and CD86 in lymph node dendritic cells, and increased the ratio of CD4+ to CD8+ T cells in lymphocytes.

Particularly, a higher ratio of CD8/Foxp3 accurately predicts prognosis for improved DFS and DMFS, and an increased CD8/CD4 ratio is an independent predictor for favourable LRFS.

When combined with the checkpoint-blockade using anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, the generated immunological responses will further promote the infiltrating CD8 and CD4 T-cells to increase the CD8/Foxp3 T-cell ratio to inhibit the growth of distant tumors beyond the direct impact range of the PA therapy.

Initial infiltration of macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes on day 11 was followed by increase in number of CD8+ cells.

HCV core treatment led to decreased interferon-gamma production in CD8+ T cells but to increased immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G production as well as cell surface expression of costimulatory and chemokine receptors, including CD86 (B7-2), CD154 (CD40L) and CD195 (CCR5), in CD20+ B cells.

Furthermore, therapy with cyclophosphamide increases IL-4-producing CD4(+) T cells and reverses the increase in IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells.

In addition, emergence of X4 variants was associated with a small but significant decline in naive CD8 T-cell numbers and increased proportions of dividing CD4 and CD8 naive, memory and effector T cells.

In the duodenum, the quadruple regimen resulted in greater CD8+ T-cell density decline, greater normalization of mucosal CCR5+CD4+ T-cells and increase of the naïve/memory CD8+ T-cell ratio, and a greater decline of sCD14 levels and duodenal HIV DNA levels (P = 0.004 and P = 0.067, respectively), with no changes in HIV RNA in plasma or tissue.

Rather, CD49a supports CD8+ TRM persistence within skin, regulates epidermal CD8+ TRM dendritic extensions, and increases the frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ TRM following local antigen challenge.

Further T cell subset analyses revealed that ILT4 expression was correlated with decreased CD8+T cell and increased Treg frequency in both cancer nest and stroma, but not with altered CD4+T cell frequency.

These results show nivolumab causes opposing effects on CD4+ and CD8+ cell populations, with CD4+ cell levels declining but increasing the proportion of Treg cells, and unconventional CD8+ T-cell levels increasing with increased expression of immune mediators by CD8+ T-cell subpopulations.

Addition of CD80-Fc to STEAP1 vaccine formulation mimicked the engagement provided by DCs and increased T cell responses to STEAP1 by 8-fold, significantly increasing the frequency of antigen-specific cells expressing IFNγ, TNFα, and CD107a for both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells.

Similarly, higher PD-1\240\+\240\CD244\240\+\240\CD3+ and PD-1\240\+\240\CD244\240\+\240\CD8+ T cells were found in BM, and an increased tendency for PD-1 + CD244 + CD4+ T cells was also detected in this group.

In the PEG-rhG-CSF group, the proportions of CD3+ T and CD4+ T cells had increased significantly (P = 0.002, P = 0.02, respectively), whereas there was no increase in CD8+ T cells.

Moreover, we found GMSCs significantly reduced cell infiltration of CD8+ cells, Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas increased CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) differentiation in lymph nodes.

Male sex determination is mediated sequentially by sex-determining region Y (SRY) and related SRY-box 9 (SOX9) transcription factors.

We recently showed that the developmentally important family of SOX (SRY (sex determining region on the Y chromosome)-related high mobility group (HMG) box) proteins require the calcium-binding protein calmodulin (CaM) for optimal nuclear accumulation, with clinical mutations in SRY that specifically impair nuclear accumulation via this pathway resulting in XY sex reversal.

One gene known to be downstream from Sry in this cascade is Sox9, which encodes a transcription factor related to Sry by the HMG box.

SRY belongs to a family of genes that are related by sequence homology within the DNA-binding domain: the genes most similar to SRY (& gt.

The aims of the study were to describe the clinical presentation and renal and bone abnormalities in a case series of HIV-infected patients receiving treatment with tenofovir (TDF), and to recommend appropriate screening for toxicity related to TDF.

At Week 96 of the Single-Tablet Regimen (STaR) study, more treatment-naïve subjects that received rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (RPV/FTC/TDF) developed resistance mutations compared to those treated with efavirenz (EFV)/FTC/TDF by population sequencing.

In collaboration with the wider Framework Committee, a subgroup considered all 14 TDF domains and iteratively developed recommendations for incorporating intersectionality considerations within the TDF and its domains.

Two overarching considerations for using the intersectionality alongside the TDF were developed by the group as well as two to four prompts for each TDF domain to guide interview topic guides.

Our findings suggest that both SRY and SOX9 contribute to the male-specific upregulation of Cbln4 in the developing testis, and they identified a direct in vivo target gene of SRY.

In the absence of Sry expression, neither XX nor XY gonads develop testes, and alterations in Sry expression are often associated with abnormal sexual differentiation.

SRY transcripts are also present in a variety of extra-gonadal tissues in the developing young and adult male, a pattern of SRY expression similar to that observed in humans.

In particular, we discuss: (1) the nature and extent of TDF-associated kidney toxicity in the HIV-infected population, (2) potential underlying mechanisms of toxicity in the proximal tubule, (3) risk factors for developing tubular dysfunction, and (4) suggested strategies to monitor patients on TDF therapy.

Preliminary studies show that intermittent intraperitoneal injections of TDF increase ambulatory and vertical activity across repeated injections [ Neurotoxicology (in press) ] leading to the hypothesis tested here, that exposure to TDF may influence the development and expression of behavioral sensitization, a model of psychostimulant-induced psychosis.

These genetic data, together with the finding that Sox9 is upregulated in Sertoli cell precursors just after SRY expression begins has led to the proposal that Sox9 could be directly regulated by SRY.

DNA bending appears to be part of the mechanism by which Sry influences transcription of genes downstream in a cascade of gene regulation leading to maleness, but the direct targets of Sry remain to be positively identified.

We demonstrate that the presence of long inverted repeats (IR) flanking the mouse Sry gene leads to the formation of the Sry circular transcript in cultured cells.

Co-administration of some HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), an oral prodrug of TFV, has been shown to increase systemic levels of TFV leading to a hypothesis that PIs may affect tubular secretion of TFV and potentially alter the renal safety of TDF.

These results support a model in which delayed testis development is caused by the presence of particular DOM SRY protein isoforms and this combined with insufficient Sry expression, causes sex reversal.

Among higher-risk subgroups in the Partners PrEP Study, including groups solely of higher-risk women, both TDF alone and combined FTC/TDF PrEP had consistently high efficacy for HIV-1 protection.

However, the increased cell loading of TFV with TAF versus TDF observed in vivo suggests that TAF may retain activity against TDF-resistant mutant viruses.

TDF interacts with other antiretrovirals and has been associated with decline in renal function and CD4 count.

Administration of high ddl doses together with TDF was associated with mitochondrial damage, which may explain the observed CD4+ T-cell decay.

The ddI plus TDF backbone seems unadvisable because of the lower associated CD4 cell counts, and because it is poorer than the other options from the immunological standpoint.

Reversibility of renal damage was prompt and complete in 59 % of patients receiving TDF-containing regimens and was associated with a higher nadir and current CD4+ T-cell count, suggesting a role of preserved cellular immunity in renal recovery in this population.

Double staining for ki-67 and sry demonstrated that the recovery acceleration after chemical injury and G-CSF treatment was mainly mediated by increased proliferation of host hepatocytes (ki-67(+)/sry(-)) with less support from BM-origin cells (ki-67(+)/sry(+)).

Together, these data suggest that SOX3 and SRY are functionally interchangeable in sex determination and support the notion that SRY evolved from SOX3 via a regulatory mutation that led to its de novo expression in the early gonad.

Adding TDF to stable, virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy regimens improved lipid parameters supporting a lipid-lowering effect of TDF.

Results of the intracellular cytokine staining indicated that TSE+ oil immunization in mice triggered both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to release IFN-γ, while CD4+ cells were mostly triggered when FA was used.

The interaction between antigen-presenting cells and the local bacterial flora contributes to an uncontrolled activation of mucosal CD4+ T lymphocytes with the consecutive release of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, IL-23, IL-27, and also IL-17, which is attributed to a specific, differentiated CD4+ lineage called Th17 (TH-IL17, THi).

CCL4-induced antinociception almost disappeared upon CD4+, but not CD8+, lymphocyte depletion with selective antibodies, thus supporting that the release of met-enk from CD4+ lymphocytes underlies the opioid antinociceptive response evoked by CCL4.

The immune CD4(+) T cells proliferated and released IL-2 and IFN-gamma profoundly in response to re-challenge with porin-pulsed macrophages but not to BSA-pulsed macrophages in vitro, which demonstrated the presence of porin-specific CD4(+) T cells of T(h) 1 phenotype.

The recombinant human CCL11 protein increased the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells, the expression of CCR3 and Foxp3, and the release of IL‑2 and TGF‑β1 in non‑tumor‑associated CD4+ T\240\cells via the STAT5 signaling pathway.

Importantly, CD4-depleted exosomes released by CD4+ T cells expressing Nef have a reduced capacity to inhibit HIV-1 infection in vitro.

Utilizing human, Mycobacterium tuberculosis-specific, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones, we demonstrate that, after recognition of antigen-presenting cells displaying peptide antigen, CD4+ T cells preferentially release interferon-gamma, whereas CD8+ T cells preferentially lyse antigen-presenting cells.

CD8 T cell interferon (IFN)-gamma production was assessed via intracellular cytokine staining, cytotoxicity via chromium release assay, and frequency of circulating and intrahepatic CYP2D6-specific CD8 T cells via tetramer staining.

We first combined the use of an HLA-A,0201/peptide binding algorithm and T2 binding assays with the induction of specific CD8(+) T cell lines from normal donors by in vitro priming with high-affinity peptides, then IFN-gamma release and cytotoxicity assays were employed to identify the specific HLA-A,0201 CD8(+) T cell epitope using peptide-loaded T2 cells or the HCA587 protein(+) HCC cell line HepG2.

The amount of IFN-gamma produced by the individual reactive T cells was evaluated as spot size, and was also influenced by the costimulatory molecules: CD54 increased also the response magnitude of cultured CTL lines, while CD80 enhanced cytokine release from freshly isolated CD8(+) T cells.

We identified a novel nonamer epitope: unstimulated peripheral blood-derived CD8 T cells displayed peptide-specific IFN-gamma release ex vivo while CD8 T cell lines and clones exhibited HLA-A68.

Further investigation exhibited RUNX3 could upregulate CCL3 and CCL20 whose receptors CCR5 and CCR6 were upregulated in CD8+ effector T cells, while downregulation of RUNX3 decreased the expression of CCL3 and CCL20 and the infiltration of CD8+ T cells in RUNX3-downregulated lung cancer cell lines.

Our data show that cells from TB patients have an increased percentage of peripheral blood CD8+ αβ+ T (p = 0.02) and CD56+ CD8+ T (p = 0.02) and a decreased frequency of NKG2D+ CD8+ T (p = 0.02) compared with healthy donors.

Interestingly, IFN-γ secretion and cytotoxic activity of 2 B4+ CD8+ T cells stimulated with HIV peptides were significantly decreased when compared to influenza peptide stimulated 2 B4+ CD8+ T cells.

Unlike wild-type IL-18, DR-18 exerted potent anti-tumour effects in mouse tumour models by promoting the development of poly-functional effector CD8+ T cells decreasing the prevalence of exhausted CD8+ T cells that express the transcriptional regulator of exhaustion TOX, and expanding the pool of stem-like TCF1+ precursor CD8+ T cells.

Furthermore, high expression levels of lncRNA-CD160 can contribute to the inhibition of IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion in CD8+ T cells and decrease the immune response of CD8+ T cells.

Anti-CD20 injection increased the frequency of apoptotic CD8+ T cells decreased the number of effector and memory CD8+ T cells, and reduced the frequency of proliferating and cytokine-producing CD8+ T cells.

The increased CD8 and decreased HHLA2 expression levels were associated with long disease-free survival in lung adenocarcinoma (P = 0.0 for CD8 expression and P = 0.004 for HHLA2 expression).

Oxysophocarpine sensitized the Lag-3 immunotherapy effect of CD8+ T cells against HCC in vivo and in vitro by decreasing Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) expression through downregulating IL-6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling, whereas Oxysophocarpine treatment had a little effect of CD8+ T cells cytotoxicity function against HCC with PD-1, Tim-3, or TIGIT blockade.

Tumors with high intratumoral neutrophil burden were marked by a blunted T-cell response characterized by reduced expression of cytotoxic T-cell genes (CD8A, CD8B, GZMA, GZMB)  decreased CD3+CD8+ cell infiltration, and diminished expression of IFNγ-related genes.

These included promoting CD8+CD28- T cells proliferation, converting CD8+CD28+ T cells to CD8+CD28- T cells and decreasing CD8+CD28- T cell death.

These data show that increase in CD8+CD28+ T cells in blood and decrease in CD8+CD28- T cells in colon are associated with experimental colitis.

The differential expression of genes also indicates that ASFV could evade both the innate and adaptive immune responses by (i) inhibiting MHC Class II antigen processing and presentation, (ii) avoiding CD8+ T effector cells and neutrophil extracellular traps via decreasing expression of neutrophil/CD8+ T effector cell-recruiting chemokines, (iii) suppressing M1 activation of macrophages, (iv) inducing immune suppressive cytokines, and (v) inhibiting the processes of macrophage autophagy and apoptosis.

Additionally, ibrutinib treatment led to an increase in MHC-II(+), CD80(+) and CCR7(+) DCs but a decrease in CD86(+) DCs upon LPS stimulation.

Consequently, flow cytometry analysis of CD8α+ cells in liver and spleen at day 5 post-infection revealed a decrease in the number of CD8α+ cells in the spleen and an increased population in the liver.

The number of CD8+ T memory cells decreased as mice aged, and CD8+ T cell recall responses and protective immunity were impaired.

Additionally, we observed increased recruitment of CD8(+) T lymphocytes to the lungs and decreased apoptosis of pulmonary CD8(+) T lymphocytes in rhIL-7-treated animals compared to those in untreated mice.

This therapeutic effect is mediated through enhanced recruitment of CD8(+) T cells and decreased apoptosis of lung T lymphocytes, with a preferential action on central memory CD8(+) T lymphocytes.

Conditional SRY expression triggered enrichment of SRY on the WDR5 promoter resulting in induction of WDR5 transcription.

The OCT4 promoter contained SRY-binding sites that were directly activated by SRY.

Furthermore, SRYs of the SRY-positive species could not activate the mutated TESCO or mouse TESCO, suggesting that SRYs lost function as a sex-determining gene any more.

Our data disprove the hypothesis that the conserved HMG box domain is the only functional domain of Sry, and highlight an evolutionary paradox whereby mouse Sry has evolved a novel bifunctional module to activate Sox9 directly, whereas SRY proteins in other taxa, including humans, seem to lack this ability, presumably making them dependent on partner proteins(s) to provide this function.

Accordingly, SRY bound to and activated the Er71 promoter, and mutation of a putative SRY binding site abolished this promoter activation.

Sry2 activated promoters at a significantly lower level than Sry1 did.

Shortly after the onset of Sry activation, Sox9 (Sry-related HMG box-9), a fundamental testis-differentiation gene common to all vertebrates, is also activated in a center-to-pole pattern similar to the initial Sry expression profile.

After incubation with EVs from SRY-transfected HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells, monocytes (THP-1) and HUVECs (human umbilical vein endothelial cells), which do not endogenously express SRY protein, were found to express newly synthesized SRY protein.

The SRY/Sry gene is expressed in pre-Sertoli cells of the male genital ridge and functions as the mammalian testis determining factor (TDF).

The wild and mutated SRY were cloned into recombinant plasmid and expressed in cells in vitro, the result showed the mutated SRY is greatly accumulated in cytoplasm while the wild type SRY is mostly localized in nucleus.

To assess the potential role of intracellular calcium in modulating SRY nuclear accumulation, Cos-7 cells expressing SRY and control constructs were treated with agents elevating or reducing intracellular Ca(2+) levels.

Sry is expressed in the mutant XY gonads, indicating that the lack of Sry expression is not the cause of ovarian tissue development in B6 Fog2-/+ or Gata4(ki)/+ XY(AKR) mice.

Cre under the control of the Sry promoter was expressed in the fetal gonads of transgenic mice similarly to endogenous Sry.

On the B6 background, Sry(POS) was expressed at about half the level of Sry(RIII) whereas Sry(AKR) and Sry(RIII) were equally expressed.

Second, sexual development and Sry expression levels were determined in XX mice carrying a transgene expressing Sry(POS) controlled by POS-derived or MUS-derived regulatory regions.

This analysis indicated: (1) Sry is first expressed in cells located centrally in the genital ridge and then later in cells located at the cranial and caudal poles, (2) Sry is expressed exclusively in pre-Sertoli cells in the urogenital ridge, and (3) Sertoli and granulosa cells develop from a common precursor.

This suggested that Sry is expressed in cells other than germ cells, which was confirmed with studies on fractionated cells--RTPCR detected transcription of Sry in the highly pure interstitial cell fraction.

Hence, SRY determines Sertoli cell fate by repressing ovarian and activating testicular differentiation genes promotes early Sertoli cells to form testis cord, and then passes on its functions to SOX9, which regulates common targets and activates its own gene regulatory program, beyond SRY actions, in sex determination.

Replacing this domain with irrelevant sequences stabilized the protein but failed to restore Sry\s ability to up-regulate its key target gene SRY-box 9 (Sox9) and its sex-determining function in vivo.

In this review the features of SRYand SOX9 expression, intracellular transport and the targets of SRY and SOX9 transcripts, the male and female signal pathways interaction and the mechanisms of initial gonadal sex differentiation are discussed.

Differentiation of the bipotential gonad into testis is initiated by the Y chromosome-linked gene SRY (Sex-determining Region Y) through upregulation of its autosomal direct target gene SOX9 (Sry-related HMG box-containing gene 9).

SRY activity was evaluated by SOX9 immunostaining, one of the targets of SRY.

The activation of the Y-linked gene Sry (sex-determining region Y) and its downstream target Sox9 (Sry box-containing gene 9) triggers testis differentiation by stimulating the differentiation of Sertoli cells, which then direct testis morphogenesis.

Sox9 is a SRY target gene, upregulated immediately after Sry expression, and plays a key role in testicular differentiation.

We also used bioinformatics simulation analysis to predict impact of the mutation on SRY function, and find the R75 in wild type SRY can form a hydrogen bond with serine at 91 (S91) that make the SRY protein well fit into the minor groove of target DNA, while the M75 in the mutated SRY can\t.

Semen exposure was assessed with: a rapid prostate-specific antigen (PSA) detection assay, a quantitative PCR targeting the sex-determining region (SRY) gene, a standard PCR targeting SRY, a standard PCR targeting TSPY, and a nested PCR targeting TSPY (n-TSPY).

Here, we show, by gel retardation analysis, that SRY recognises specific DNA sequences and that such sequences exist upstream of the AMH promoter, a potential downstream target for SRY.

While biochemical studies of clinical mutants and mouse genetic models have helped in our understanding of SRY function, no direct downstream targets of SRY have yet been identified.

The Y chromosome-linked gene sex-determining region Y (SRY) is believed to be the master initiator of male sex determination in almost all eutherian and metatherian mammals, functioning to upregulate expression of its direct target gene Sry-related HMG box-containing gene 9 (SOX9).

This repression machinery is recruited to SRY target promoters in chromatin templates via SRY.

Little is known about SRY regulation and its mode of action during testis development, and direct gene targets for SRY are still lacking.

Here we review our current understanding of Sry regulation and provide a model that assembles all known regulators into three modules, each converging on a single transcription factor that binds to the Sry promoter.

The Sox (Sry-type HMG box) genes encode a group of proteins characterized by the existence of an SRY (sex-determining region on Y chromosome) box, a 79 amino acid motif that encodes an HMG (high mobility group) domain which can bind and bend DNA, which is the only part in SRY that is conserved between species.

Moreover, the transcription factor GATA4, which is required for Sry expression binds to\240\the Sry promoter in\240\vivo in a MAPK-dependent manner.

In an immunoprecipitation-based pull-down assay, recombinant SRY protein bound the Ntf3 promoter fragment containing an intact SRY binding site, whereas the same protein did not interact with the fragment containing a mutated SRY motif.

Functional analysis of potential SRY binding sites within this deleted region identified five putative enhancers, suggesting that sequences additional to the known SRY-binding TES enhancer influence human testis-specific SOX9 expression.

In summary, our study demonstrates that Sp1 is a major regulator in SRY gene transcription, and mutations of the Sp1 binding sites (Sp1-B and Sp1-C) in the 5 \ flanking region of SRY induce sex reversal in rabbits, which can be used as targets for clinical research of male-to-female sex reversal syndrome.

Observations demonstrate the majority of the previously identified normal SRY binding sites were not altered and the altered SRY binding sites were novel and new additional sites.

161 delG) led to a premature stop codon at amino acid 59 in the SRY protein, which resulted in lacking the DNA binding domain of SRY protein.

in the SRY protein, which resulted in lacking the DNA binding domain of SRY protein.

The HMG box of human SRY could bind directly to beta-catenin while the mouse Sry binds to beta-catenin via its HMG box and glutamine-rich domain.

Mutation, co-transfection and sex-reversal studies all point to a feedforward, self-reinforcing pathway in which SF1 and SRY cooperatively upregulate Sox9 and then, together with SF1, SOX9 also binds to the enhancer to help maintain its own expression after that of SRY has ceased.

These results also indicate that at least one tda gene regulates Sry expression, possibly by directly binding to Sry regulatory regions.

We found several SRY/Sox binding sites in this region and co-transfection experiments showed that SRY could down regulate mMsh4 promoter transcriptional activity.

We have examined if the Sry gene contain DNA binding sites for the SRY protein itself.

We have found that in an in vitro assay, the SRY protein binds to several sites of the Sry gene and especially to a (CA) 25 sequence and to a (CAG) 30 repeat.

We demonstrate that purified SRY protein binds strongly to one of the putative fra-1 HMG-box response elements and that SRY enhances the transcription of rat fra-1 promoter constructs in cotransfection experiments.

Sry can also bind to this motif, indicating that the Sry family may have overlapping sequence specificities.

The regulation of CXCR4 expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes by IL-4 and IL-10 could be blocked by a selective inhibitor of protein kinase (staurosporine) or by a selective inhibitor of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (H-8), indicating that these cytokines regulate CXCR4 on CD4+ T lymphocytes via both cAMP and cGMP signalling pathways.

The function of ZIKV NS4A in regulating growth is maintained in the wing, where ZIKV NS4A overexpression in the pouch domain results in reduced growth linked with diminished expression of Notch targets, Wingless (Wg) and Cut, and the Notch reporter, NRE-GFP Thus, our study provides evidence that ZIKV infection in Drosophila results in restricted growth of the developing eye and wing, wherein eye phenotype is induced through regulation of JAK/STAT signaling, whereas restricted wing growth is induced through regulation of Notch signaling.

In summation, we showed the potential of pacritinib alone or in combination with TMZ to suppress GBM tumorigenesis via modulating STAT3/miR-21/PDCD4 signaling.

Unexpectedly, early priming of CD4+ T cells against tumour-derived antigens also required cDC1, and this was not simply because they transport antigens to lymph nodes for processing by cDC2, as selective deletion of major histocompatibility class II molecules in cDC1 also prevented early CD4+ T cell priming.

CD4 T cells support a variety of cells required for protective immunity, and perturbations to the CD4 T cell compartment can decrease overall immune system fitness.

Finally, we highlight how tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells and dendritic cells interact with CD8 T cells within organized lymphoid-like areas in the tumor and propose a CD8 T cell differentiation model that requires the collaboration of CD4 T cells and dendritic cells.

TCR activation of CD4(+) target T cells was required for CD8(+) Treg cells to exert suppressive activity, which was mediated through lysis of CD4(+) targets in a cell contact-dependent manner.

Jak3 is constitutively associated with CD40, and this interaction requires a proline-rich sequence in the membrane-proximal region of CD40.

Consequently, the anti-atherogenic role of CD44 may require CD44-deficiency on cell types other than inflammatory cells in the LDL receptor-deficient mouse model.

HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) T cells requires binding of the virus to CD4 followed by engagement of either the C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) coreceptor.

Sustained signals by interaction between MHC class II and TCR/CD4 is required for commitment to the CD4 helper lineage.

The CD4+ T cell help required for the development and maintenance of the GC is delivered by follicular Th cells (T(FH)), a CD4+ Th cell subset characterized by expression of Bcl-6 and secretion of IL-21.

Consistent with this, genetic ablation of MHC II in tumor cells, both in the case of B lymphoma and B16 melanoma, did not preclude rejection of tumors by tumor antigen-specific CD4+ T cells in vivo These findings demonstrate that MHC class II expression on tumor cells themselves is not required for CD4+ T-cell-mediated rejection and that indirect display on host APC is sufficient for effective tumor elimination.

The CD4+ lineage-specific transcription factor Thpok is required for intrathymic CD4+ T cell differentiation and, together with its homolog LRF, supports CD4+ T cell helper effector responses.

We found that while envelopes with low CD4 dependence tend to infect primary CD4(+) T cells better than those required optimum CD4 for entry, no significant association was found between low CD4 usage and infectivity of primary CD4(+) T cells by Env-pseudotyped viruses and their sensitivity to CCR5 antagonist TAK-779.

CD4+ T-cell killing required HIV1 fusion and/or entry into these cells, but neither HIV1 envelope-mediated CD4 or CXCR4 signaling nor the presence of the HIV1 Nef protein in the viral particles.

Using flow cytometric techniques to assess the binding and entry of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Vpr-labeled HIV virions into primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we have found that HIV fusion and endocytosis are restricted to the CD4-expressing subset of cells and that both pathways commonly require the initial binding of HIV virions to surface CD4 receptors.

These results indicate that engagement of both CD4 and CXCR4 is required for HIV-induced shedding of L-selectin on primary resting CD4(+) T cells.

Furthermore, chimeric viruses expressing gp120 proteins with reduced CD4 binding abilities are viable, suggesting that primary viruses may require a less avid interaction with the receptor CD4 to initiate infection than do their laboratory-adapted counterparts.

Infection and entry of CD4(+) cells by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires a coreceptor molecule, which, in concert with CD4, interacts with the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), leading to membrane fusion.

HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) cells requires the sequential interactions of the viral envelope glycoproteins with CD4 and a coreceptor such as the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4.

The presence of CD4 and CXCR4 on target cells is required for this process, but Env-induced autophagy is independent of CD4 signaling.

The simple relation between viral load and CD4 T-cell depletion allows prediction of the level of viral control required to prevent CD4 T-cell depletion in acute SHIV infection.

Of note, although HSV-2 induced the expression of all the three CXCR3 ligands, the induced CXCL9 appeared to play a predominant role in promoting CD4+ T cell migration, reflecting that the concentrations of CXCL10 and CXCL11 required for CD4+ T cell migration are higher than that of CXCL9.

Furthermore, CD4+ T cell intrinsic IL-21R/STAT3 signaling was required for CD4+ T cell effector responses, including IL-22 production.

Under physiological conditions, activation of CD4+ T cells by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen complexes requires engagement of both the T cell receptor and the CD4 molecule.

The membrane glycoprotein CD4 is required for optimal antigen-mediated activation of CD4+ T cells restricted by class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

The CD4-dependent alteration of adhesion required the association of CD4 with p56lck because expression of mutant forms of CD4 unable to bind p56lck resulted in a lack of CD4-dependent regulation of adhesion.

Our lab has shown that the interaction of B and CD4 T cells that is central to MAIDS pathogenesis requires ligation of CD40 on B cells by CD154 on CD4 T cells.

Runx1 is required for active repression in CD4(-) CD8(-) thymocytes whereas Runx3 is required for establishing epigenetic silencing in cytotoxic lineage thymocytes.

Here we show that the transcription factor AML1 (acute myeloid leukaemia 1)/Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), which is crucially required for normal haematopoiesis including thymic T-cell development, activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells through binding to their respective promoters.

Through the use of Runx1-overexpressing cells from transgenic mice, we demonstrate that interference with TCR-mediated Runx1 down-regulation inhibits IL-2 production and proliferation in activated CD4+ T cells.

Our chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Runx1 inhibits the elongation but not initiation of transcription and that RNAPII is engaged at the CD4 promoter but is unable to elongate in CD4(-) CD8(+) thymoma cells.

Here we show that the transcription factor AML1 (acute myeloid leukaemia 1)/Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), which is crucially required for normal haematopoiesis including thymic T-cell development activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells through binding to their respective promoters.

We find arginine-methylated RUNX1 on the promoters of two bona fide RUNX1 target genes, CD41 and PU.

Runx1 may also be involved in CD4 silencing in CD8+ T-cells.

The Runx1 domains involved in regulating the expression of several genes in peripheral CD4(+) T cells were analysed.

Runx1 binds the CD4 silencer and represses transcription in immature double negative thymocytes.

BAF57 dominant negative mutant does not alter these frames, but reduces the accessibility of the entire silencer without affecting the flanking regions, concomitant with localized accumulation of linker histone H1 and eviction of Runx1, a key repressor of CD4 transcription that directly binds the CD4 silencer.

Runx1 binds the silencer and represses CD4 transcription in immature thymocytes.

Furthermore, the CD44 promoter is bound by AML1-ETO9a and AML1-ETO at the chromatin level.

Runx1 also activates CD8 as the double negative population progresses to double positive thymocytes.

Runx3 establishes epigenetic silencing in CD4-CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells by binding the CD4 silencer core sequence.

Using GPI-anchored ZZ to couple anti-CD4 antibodies to liposomes, we created immunoliposomes with a binding efficiency of 75 % to CD4+ cells in splenocytes and minimal off-target binding.

Conversely, the proximal D4 domain of CD4 is the binding site of the cytokine IL-16 and is highly conserved, allowing for promiscuous binding of IL-16 to CD4 between disparate gnathostomes.

The use of small-molecule viral inhibitors that allosterically block CD4 binding represents an alternative strategy for stabilizing Env trimer in the pre-CD4 triggered state of both soluble and membrane-bound trimers.

Furthermore, OPN was found to induce H3 acetylation of the IL17A gene promoter, mainly through the CD44 binding domain in CD4+ T cells, allowing the interaction of the IL17A gene locus with ROR.

HR1 mutations had minimal effect on virus sensitivity to other classes of entry inhibitors, including those targeting CD4 binding (BMS-806 and a CD4-specific monoclonal antibody [ MAb]), coreceptor binding (CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3100 and CCR5 inhibitor TAK-779), or fusion (T-1249), indicating that ENF-resistant viruses can remain sensitive to other entry inhibitors in vivo.

By contrast, the CD4-langerin and CD4-mannose binding lectin (MBL) CARs uniformly displayed enhanced potency compared with the CD4 CAR against all the genetically diverse HIV-1 isolates examined.

Strikingly, iMac239 retained the ability to replicate in cell lines and primary cells even when its CD4 binding site had been ablated by deletion of a highly conserved aspartic acid at position 385, which, for HIV-1, plays a critical role in CD4 binding.

At least in a single patient, T cells binding to the AAGIGILTV epitope were detected in naive, precursor (CD45RA+/CCR7+) CD8+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells binding to the analog ELAGIGILTV peptide were identified in the terminally differentiated (CD45RA+/CCR7-) T-cell subset.

An extensive in vitro binding study indicated that TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind to the CD40 cytoplasmic tail (CD40ct) with much higher affinity than TRAF5 and TRAF6 and that TRAF2 and TRAF3 bind to different residues of the CD40ct.

Using CD40 mutants incapable of binding TRAF2, TRAF3, or Jak3, we found that the TRAF2-binding site of the CD40ct is critical for NF-kappaB and stress-activated protein kinase activation, as well as the up-regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) gene, whereas binding of TRAF3 and Jak3 is dispensable for all of these functions.

Although D1D2-CD4-CCR5 was sufficient to permit ENV-mediated fusion, D1-CD4-CCR5 and human D1/mouse D2-CD4-CCR5 lacked CD4 function and binding to a neutralizing antibody mapped to D1-CD4.

In particular, a CD4-specific MAb designated DB81 (IgG1Κ) was found to preferentially bind to a complex-enhanced epitope on the D2 domain of human CD4.

Many amino acid substitutions were common across mice, including losses of N-linked glycosylation sites and substitutions in the CD4 binding site and in CD4-induced epitopes, indicating common selective pressures between mice.

Both siRNA-mediated reduction of CD44 expression and antibodies that block the interaction of CD44 with HA provided evidence that CXCL12-induced CXCR4 signaling depends on the binding of hHA to CD44.

We have developed a binding assay to show that HIV envelope (Env) can interact with CXCR4 independently of CD4 but that this binding is markedly enhanced by the previous interaction of Env with soluble CD4.

Because human CD4+ T-cell reactivity relies on the recognition of peptides bound to HLA class II, prediction, or measurement of the capacity of different peptides to bind or be natural ligands of HLA class II is used as a predictor of CD4+ T-cell reactivity and ADA development.

CD40, a costimulatory receptor molecule, expressed mainly on antigen presenting cells, some non-immune cells and tumors binds to CD40 ligand molecule expressed transiently on T-cells and non-immune cells under inflammatory conditions.

Here we report on a complementary approach to expand specific B cells using an anti-idiotypic antibody, iv8, that selects for naive human B cells expressing immunoglobulin light chains with 5-amino acid complementarity determining region 3 s, a key feature of anti-CD4 binding site (CD4bs)-specific VRC01-class antibodies.

Elicitation of broadly neutralizing Ab (bNAb) responses toward the conserved HIV-1 envelope (Env) CD4 binding site (CD4bs) by vaccination is an important goal for vaccine development and yet to be achieved.

Here we describe 1-18, a new VH1-46-encoded CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bNAb with outstanding breadth (97 %) and potency (GeoMean IC50\240\= 0.048 \240\μg/mL).

Analysis of the T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of innate CD4(+) T cells selected by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-dependent thymocyte-thymocyte (T-T) interaction (T-T CD4(+) T cells) is essential for predicting the characteristics of the antigens that bind to these T cells and for distinguishing T-T CD4(+) T cells from other types of innate T cells.

As opposed to other cytokines, whose effects are not limited to the CD4(+) T cell subset, IL-16 exerts its biological properties by exclusive binding and signaling through CD4 receptor.

The pan HLA-DR binding epitope (PADRE peptide) is capable of generating antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that bind various MHC class II molecules with high affinity and has been widely used in conjunction with vaccines to improve their potency by enhancing CD4+ T cell responses.

In vivo, these CD8+ T cells form direct stable contacts with motile naïve CD4+ T cells, recruiting them to Ag+DC binding and to the formation of ternary complexes, where CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interact with the DC and with one another.

this was accompanied by increased sCD4 sensitivity, with structural changes in the CD4 binding site, the V3 loop and/or the fusion domain of their Envs that are suggestive of better CD4 contact, CCR5 usage and/or virus fusion.

In the absence of immunological restrictions, variants that adopt an " open" Env to expose the CD4 binding site for better CD4 use are selected, allowing structural changes that confer CXCR4-use to be manifested.

On the other hand, layer 1 plays an important role in stabilizing the CD4-bound conformation of HIV-1 but not SIVmac gp120 and thus contributes to HIV-1 binding to CD4.

Both groups of Envs also exhibited the same CD4+ T cell subset tropism and showed similar sensitivity to neutralization by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) antibodies.

Moreover, LSA inhibits CD4-gp120 interaction by blocking the binding of antibodies specific for CD4-binding sites (CD4bs) and for the V3 loop of gp120.

Neutralization assays designed to measure the effects of CCR5 ECL2 peptides when combined with either with the small molecule CD4 mimetic NBD-556, soluble CD4, or the CCR5 N terminus showed additive inhibition for each, indicating that ECL2 binds gp120 at a site distinct from that of N terminus and acts independently of CD4.

The results indicate some conserved features in both systems, such as the rigidity of the gp120 core, the conservation of the CD4 Phe43-gp120 binding cavity contacts, a high flexibility of the V3 loop particularly in the CD4 bound form.

We show that, prior to the time of coreceptor switch, R5 viruses in both macaques evolved to become increasingly sCD4-sensitive, suggestive of enhanced exposure of the CD4 binding site and an " open" envelope conformation, and this correlated with better gp120 binding to CD4 and with more efficient infection of CD4(low) cells such as primary macrophages.

A fusion of the CD4- and CCR5-mimetic peptides, DM1 bound gp120 and neutralized R5, R5X4, and X4 HIV-1 isolates comparably to CD4, and they did so markedly more efficiently than either peptide alone.

PF-68742 was not able to block binding of monomeric gp120 to soluble CD4 or the binding of gp120:CD4 complexes to cell-associated CCR5, thus distinguishing PF-68742 from described gp120 antagonists and coreceptor binders.

How does CD4 binding trigger conformational changes in gp120 that allow the gp41 transmembrane envelope glycoprotein to mediate viral-cell membrane fusion? The transition from the unliganded to the CD4-bound state is regulated by two potentially flexible topological layers (layers 1 and 2) in the gp120 inner domain.

We used fluorescence spectroscopy to determine that PA binds to the CD4 receptor with K(d) approximately 1.5 +/- 0.2 microM, and we used one-dimensional saturation transfer difference NMR (STD-NMR) to determined that the PA binding epitope for CD4 consists of the hydrophobic methyl and methelene groups located away from the PA carboxyl terminal, which blocks efficient gp120-CD4 attachment.

The adaptive amino acid changes had no impact on CCR5 antagonist resistance but made virus more sensitive to neutralization by antibodies to the CD4 binding site, modestly enhanced affinity for CD4, and made TA1 more responsive to CD4 binding.

Pre-incubation of cells with a saturating concentration of anti-CD4 mAbs reduced the antiviral potency of CD4-BFFI, suggesting that binding of CD4-BFFI to the cell surface via its CD4 mAb portion is required for the antiviral potency of its fusion inhibitor moiety.

gp120 from two functional HIV-1 subtype C clones, Du151 and MOLE1, bound CCR5 with high affinity in the presence of CD4 and Du151 showed significant CCR5 binding in the absence of CD4.

Adsorption with gp120 immobilized on beads revealed that an often large but variable fraction of plasma neutralization was directed to gp120 and that in some cases, neutralization was largely mediated by CD4 binding site (CD4bs) Abs.

Here we adapt methods from combinatorial chemistry to optimize CD4M33, a synthetic miniprotein into which we had previously transplanted the HIV-1 gp120 binding surface of the CD4 receptor.

The CD4 binding site on FAT presents the same features as the established CD4 binding site on the HIV-1 Nef protein.

The binding of FAT to CD4 is incompatible with the binding of Lck to CD4.

Molecular models indicate N362 is located adjacent to the CD4 binding loop of gp120, and suggest N362 may enhance fusogenicity by promoting greater exposure of the CD4bs and/or stabilizing the CD4-bound Env structure.

In the CD4-bound state, however, V1/V2 loop was rearranged near the bound CD4 to support CD4 binding.

Two CD4 binding site (CD4bs) Abs also showed this behavior relatively infrequently.

Here, we report on an anti-CD4 mAb (15 A7) that displays a unique binding specificity for domain 1 of CD4, whose epitope partially overlaps with the gp120 binding region.

Conformational integrity was further demonstrated by its high affinity binding to soluble CD4, CD4 binding site antibodies such as b12 and VRC01, quaternary epitope-specific antibody PG9, and CD4-induced epitope-specific antibody 17 b.

Env possesses conserved antigenic determinants, such as the gp120 primary receptor CD4 binding site (CD4bs), a known neutralization target.

Binding kinetics revealed high-affinity recognition by seven broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies and low to no binding by non-broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies.

HIV and SIV generally require CD4 binding prior to coreceptor engagement, but Env can acquire the ability to use CCR5 independently of CD4 under various circumstances.

The same inhibitor, antibodies blocking the CD4 binding site on gp120, or soluble CD4 also prevented the increase in expression of CXCR5 or PD-1, and reduced the levels of Fas-dependent cell death.

The virus infects CD4 T cells through binding to CD4 and one of the chemokine coreceptors, CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 (R5).

However, CD4+ uninfected bystander cells in HIV+ cell cultures bind gp120 shed from HIV+ cells exposing CD4-induced epitopes normally hidden in native Env.

In this study, we investigated CD4 binding to mac-tropic and non-mac-tropic Env trimers and showed that CD4-IgG binds efficiently to mac-tropic R5 Env trimers, while binding to non-mac-tropic trimers was undetectable.

Our data indicated that the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) is highly occluded on Env trimers of non-mac-tropic R5 viruses.

Small-molecule CD4-mimetic compounds (CD4mc) bind gp120 and act as competitive inhibitors of gp120-CD4 engagement.

We observed that a network of interactions involving some residues of the β8-α5 region in SIVmac239 layer 3 may contribute to CD4 binding by helping shape the nearby Phe 43 cavity, which directly contacts CD4.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects blood CD4 T cells through binding to CD4 and the chemokine co-receptor, CXCR4 or CCR5.

HIV-1 specifically targets CD4+ helper T-cells of the human immune system and binds to the receptor CD4 and coreceptor CCR5 before fusion is initiated.

Studies aimed at elucidating mechanisms regulating infection of these cells revealed that CD4+ CD25- cells were less susceptible to FIV binding and entry than CD4+ CD25+ cells, which correlated with increased surface expression of FIV coreceptor CXCR4.

CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies bind gp120 more efficiently after CD4 binding and block the interaction with the chemokine receptor.

Here we report the identification of a novel antibody, E51, that exhibits CD4-induced binding to gp120 and neutralizes primary HIV-1 more efficiently than the prototypic CD4i antibodies.

Anti-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) antibodies whose binding to gp120 is enhanced by CD4 binding (CD4i antibodies) are generally considered nonneutralizing for primary HIV-1 isolates.

CD4-independent Env\s of HIV type 1 (HIV-1), HIV-2, and SIV have been identified that exhibit exposed chemokine receptor binding sites and can bind directly to CCR5 or CXCR4 in the absence of CD4.

CD4-binding-site (CD4BS) antibodies are neutralizing antibodies elicited during natural infection that are directed against gp120 epitopes that overlap the binding site for CD4.

Conversely, CD4 ectodomain targeting to a nonraft membrane fraction results in a CD4 receptor with severely diminished capacity to mediate Lck activation or HIV-1 entry, although this mutant binds gp120 as well as CD4wt.

To study the relationships between CD4 independence, neutralization sensitivity, and exposure of CD4-induced epitopes associated with the coreceptor binding site, we generated a large panel of Env mutants and chimeras between 8 x and its CD4-dependent parent, HXBc2.

Exposure of the CD4-induced epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 17 b and which overlaps the coreceptor binding site was highly sensitive to an R298K mutation at the base of the V3 loop and was often but not always associated with CD4 independence.

The results illustrate that the measured effects of CV-N on gp120-CD4 binding interactions depend upon the type of CD4 (soluble or cell associated), but not upon the type of gp120 (soluble or virion associated), employed in the experimental protocol.

We find that the presence or absence of this V3 glycan on clade A and B viruses accorded various degrees of susceptibility to neutralization by antibodies to the CD4 binding site, CD4-induced epitopes, and chemokine receptors.

CD4-specific monoclonal antibodies (CG1, CG7, and CG8), which bind with a 5-to 10-fold higher avidity to preformed CD4-gp120 complexes than to CD4, were previously shown to recognize newly identified conformational epitopes in the D1-CDR3 region of CD4.

Infection of CD4+ T-lymphocytes by HIV-1 is initiated by binding of the virus to the CD4 receptor on the lymphocyte surface, followed by fusion of the virus with the cell membrane (1).

In contrast, the binding of virus was only partially inhibited by neutralizing anti-CD4 MAbs against the gp120 binding site in CD4, which, like the anti-V3 loop MAbs, completely inhibited HIV entry and infection.

Here we show that the binding of soluble gp120 from one macrophage-tropic and four T cell-tropic viruses to a CD4+, but not to a CD4-, T cell line, decreased the binding of an mAb specific for CXCR4 to its epitope, implying an interaction among gp120, CD4, and CXCR4.

HIV-1 attachment inhibitors (AIs), which potently inhibit Env-CD4 binding and subsequent downstream effects of Env, display low-nanomolar antiapoptotic potency and prevent CD4(+)-T-cell depletion from mixed lymphocyte cultures, also with low-nanomolar potency.

TA1 could use CCR5 but not CXCR4 to infect cells, and was extremely sensitive to neutralization by HIV-1 positive human sera, and by antibodies to the CD4 binding site and to CD4-induced epitopes in the bridging sheet region of gp120.

Although HIV Env has been implicated in apoptosis of uninfected CD4 T cells via gp120 binding to either CD4 and/or the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), conflicting data exist concerning the molecular mechanisms involved.

Using primary human CD4 T cells, we demonstrate that gp120 binding to CD4 T cells activates proapoptotic p38, but does not activate antiapoptotic Akt.

The observed binding to the viral envelope spikes is the result of specific CD4-gp120 interaction, because binding was not observed with MICA-IgP, a construct that is identical to D1D2-IgP except that major histocompatibility complex Class I-related Chain A (MICA) replaces the CD4 moiety.

A panel of monoclonal Abs (MAbs), used to opsonize these target cells, showed that infected cells were preferentially recognized/eliminated by MAbs to CD4 binding site, V3 loop, and viral spike epitopes whereas bystander/coated cells were preferentially recognized/eliminated by Abs to CD4-induced (CD4i) epitopes.

The exceptions to the contiguous glycan shield include the conserved receptor CD4 binding site (CD4bs) and glycoprotein (gp) 41 elements proximal to the furin cleavage site.

Broad and potent neutralizing llama single domain antibodies (VHH) against HIV-1 targeting the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) have previously been isolated upon llama immunization.

The CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein is susceptible to multiple lineages of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that are attractive to elicit with vaccines.

As a result, five top-ranking compounds that mimic the key interactions of CD4 with gp120 and show the high binding affinity were identified as the most promising CD4-mimemic candidates.

We created HIV-specific CAR-T cells using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and a CAR construct that enables the expression of CD4 (domains 1 and 2) and the carbohydrate recognition domain of mannose binding lectin (MBL) to target native HIV Env (CD4-MBL CAR).

Although HIV/SIV infections result in the abundant production of CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies (Abs), these Abs are not protective due to steric restrictions following gp120 binding to CD4 on target cells.

The CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the envelope glycoprotein is a major site of vulnerability that is conserved among different HIV-1 isolates.

To systematically explore how immunization might be tailored to produce them, we generated mice expressing the predicted germline or mature heavy chains of a potent bNAb to the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) on the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env).

Env immunogens were designed to induce CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAbs, but surprisingly, the macaque developed V1V2-glycan bnAbs.

The strategy of this system is to count CD4 cells indirectly, by measuring the free CD4 antibodies that were not bound by CD4 cells.

Human CD4 binds to HIV gp120 in a manner strikingly similar to the way in which CD4 interacts with pMHCII.

When CD4 binds to alternative ligands such as HIV-1 gp120 or anti-CD4 Abs, Ag stimulation of TCR/CD3 is markedly inhibited, and an unresponsive state develops.

To test this possibility, we transfected the F43I CD4 mutant, which is incapable of binding to class II MHC or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gp120, into COS-7 cells together with wild-type CD4 (wtCD4).

Although CD4 transfection in CD4low HUT78 T cell lines did not significantly modify their maximal binding to B cells and fibroblasts, it made the LFA-1-dependent adhesion sensitive to inhibition by anti-CD4 Ab, HIV-1 (env) gp 160, and a 12-mer peptide encompassing the 35-46 sequence of the beta 1 domain of the MHC class II molecule.

Screening of microbial metabolites for CD4-binding activity using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on the binding of the CD4-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-Leu3a, identified a family of compounds comprising several novel polyketides.

Anergy of non-infected CD4 cells, resulting in cytokine dysregulation may be promoted by impairing the CD4-MHC interaction during CD4 cell activation either directly through the SLWDQ pentapeptide identity with the CD4 molecule and the CD4 binding region or through a gp120-induced autoimmune reaction to CD4.

The CD4 dimer allows tight binding to a large surface of MHC-II and the complex of CD4 and MHC-II reconciles mutational analysis studies that were previously incompatible.

Since HIV uses CD4 as a receptor, it may bind to CD4 homologues on CMV, HTLV, EBV or sperm proteins.

Strategies of drug design aimed at interrupting CD4-HIV interaction will need to consider the extensive overlap between class II MHC and HIV gp120 binding surfaces in this region of CD4.

Anti-CD4 antibodies, which cross-compete with gp120 for binding to CD4, inhibited the response to antigen of monoclonal T cells.

Comparison of the amino acid sequences of human, mouse and rat CD4 revealed that basic residues in human CD4 which could participate in a polyanion binding site are conserved in mouse and rat CD4.

It is thought therefore that at least part of the gp160 inhibitory activity is not secondary to CD4 modulation but may rely either upon steric hindrance of CD4-MHC class II interaction, of CD4/CD3 TCR complex interaction, or upon negative signaling through binding to CD4.

Together, these results support the role of part of the 418-460 region of gp160 as a binding site to CD4, and suggest that binding of part of this region to CD4 can alter T cell proliferation and adhesion.

We have studied a series of mutants in the region of amino acids 42-49 of CD4 for their ability to bind gp120, to interact with class II MHC, to enhance T-cell activation, and to bind a panel of anti-CD4 antibodies.

These observations are consistent with a three-dimensional model of the V1 domain of CD4 that was developed in order to understand the structural basis for binding to CD4.

CD4 also functions as a receptor for human immunodeficiency virus type-I (HIV-1) because the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 binds to CD4 with a high affinity.

The remaining three contain sequences that had been previously demonstrated to induce CD8+ T cell response in Chagas\ disease patients, or bind HLA-A,02:01, but are, in this study, demonstrated to engage CD4+ T cells.

CD4+ T cells recognize MHC 2 bound antigens, while CD8+ T cells recognize MHC 1 bound antigens.

The control of many persistent viral infections by Ag-specific cytolytic CD8+ T cells requires a concurrent virus-specific CD4+ Th cell response.

Finally, mature DCs pulsed with matrix peptide induced CTLs from highly purified CD8+ T cells without requiring CD4+ T cell help.

Subset analysis demonstrated that CD4+ T cells or addition of exogenous interleukin-2 was required for the induction of CD8+ CTL.

However, in the absence of inflammatory conditions, cooperation between CD4 and CD8 T cells likely is required for an effective primary CD8 T cell response directed against allo-HLA class I.

Thus, combinations of CD4(+) Th1 immune interventions and multivalent targeting of HER family members may be required for optimal anti-HER2/neu CD8(+) T-cell-directed immunotherapy.

In immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients, a delayed appearance of HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells is associated with prolonged viremia and more severe clinical disease, while in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, it has been suggested that HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells are required for HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells to exert their anti-viral effects.

In addition, adoptive T-cell immunotherapy in transplant patients has shown that the presence of HCMV-specific CD4+ T cells is required for the maintenance of HCMV-specific CD8+ T cells.

Recovery of the HSV-specific CD8+ T cell population after stress and corticosterone treatment occurred with homeostatic levels of cell division and did not require CD4+ T cell help.

Despite this rapid expression, CD49a is not required for the generation of a primary CD8+ T\240\cell response to cutaneous herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, migration of CD8+ T\240\cells across the epidermal basement membrane, or positioning of TRM within basal epidermis.

CD4+ T cell help is required for the generation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) memory.

Host defense against viruses and intracellular parasites depends on effector CD8(+) T cells, whose optimal clonal expansion, differentiation, and memory properties require signals from CD4(+) T cells.

Our findings indicate that CD4+ T-cell help is required to establish an effective antiviral CD8+ T-cell response in the liver during acute viral infection.

In a mouse model achieving fully MHC-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow engraftment with minimal conditioning (3 Gy total body irradiation followed by anti-CD154 and T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow cells), CD4 T cells in the recipient are required to promote tolerance of preexisting alloreactive recipient CD8 T cells and thereby permit chimerism induction.

Memory CD8+ T cell activation within allografts subjected to prolonged CIS requires memory CD4+ T cell stimulation of graft DCs to produce p40 homodimers, but not IL-12 p40/p35 heterodimers.

Furthermore, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes require activation by CD4+ T cells.

Using murine anti-thymocyte globulin (mATG) in a mouse model of heart transplantation, we previously reported that the homeostatic recovery of CD8+ T cells requires help from depletion-resistant memory CD4+ T cells delivered through CD40-expressing B cells.

Following this initial priming immunization with LAMP/gag DNA, booster immunizations with native gag DNA or the LAMP/gag chimera are equally efficient in eliciting B- and T-cell secondary responses, results in accordance with observations that secondary expansion of CD8+ cells in the boost phase does not require additional CD4+ help.

Collaboration between proliferating CD4-positive cells and CD8-positive cells may thus be required to produce CTL of the CD8 phenotype.

The data suggest that cytotoxic CD4+ T-cells may play a significant role in immunity to melanoma, and HLA class-I-restricted recognition of melanoma may not necessarily require the CD8 molecule on the lytic T-cell.

Optimal priming of single-cell gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by CD8(+) T cells required CD4(+) T cells and was broadly directed to multiple regions of Gag, Env, and Nef that corresponded to known and predicted major histocompatibility complex class I epitopes.

In the nine HLA-B:Bw4-80Ile-positive patients, we demonstrated a strong viral suppression by KIR3DL1-expressing CD8(+) T-cells that required cell-to-cell contact to switch off the activation signals in infected CD4(+) T-cells.

In summary, our data demonstrate that CD4+ T cells require continuous stimulation for clonal expansion, whereas CD8+ T cells can divide following a much shorter TCR signal.

The ability of primed macrophages to reject allografts essentially requires the help of CD4+ T cells and does not require the help of CD8+ T cells.

However, the paucity of terminally differentiated CD8(+) T cells at tumor site suggests that immunotherapy strategies may require not only the boosting of tumor immunity, but also effective means to promote CD8(+) T-cell differentiation in the neoplastic tissue.

CD8(+) T-cell depletion completely abrogated the vaccine efficacy, and so protection required CD8(+) T cells.

We found significantly higher frequencies of SNV-specific T cells in patients with severe HPS requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 44.2 % of CD8(+) T cells) than in moderately ill HPS patients hospitalized but not requiring mechanical ventilation (up to 9.8 % of CD8(+) T cells).

In mice, T cell factor 1 (TCF-1) maintains exhausted CD8+ T cell responses, whereas thymocyte selection-associated HMG box (TOX) is required for the epigenetic remodeling and survival of exhausted CD8+ T cells.

Adam15 deficiency in CD8+ T cells was required for the exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and COPD-like disease in CS-exposed Adam15-/- mice (as assessed by genetically deleting CD8+ T cells in Adam15-/- mice).

The Cd8 enhancer E8(I) and Runx/core-binding factor-β (CBFβ) complexes were required for the establishment of this regulatory circuit, because E8(I)-, Runx3-, or CBFβ-deficient CD8(+) T cells down-regulated CD8α expression during activation.

Moreover, activated E8 I-core-/-E8 VI -/- CD8+ T cells lost CD8 expression to a greater degree than E8 I-core-/- and E8 VI -/- CD8+ T cells, suggesting that the combined activity of both enhancers is required for establishment and maintenance of CD8 expression before and after TCR activation.

While CD8+ T cell recovery required MHC class I expression in the host, the reconstitution occurred independently of MHC class I, MHC class II, or CD80/CD86 expression on B cells.

The relative reliance on these pathways is contingent on the nature of the secondary challenge (greater for chronic than acute viral infections) and over time, aging CD8+TM re-establish a dependence on the same accessory signals required for effective priming of naïve CD8+T cells in the first place.

By studying knockout mice, we provide evidence that CD8+ T cells are required for the displacement of the DETC and that DETC are not required for recruitment of CD8+ TRM cells to the epidermis following allergen exposure.

Type 1 CD8α+ conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are required for CD8+ T\240\cell priming but, paradoxically, promote splenic Listeria monocytogenes infection.

Moreover, thymocyte selection-associated high mobility group box protein TOX (TOX) promoted the persistence of antiviral CD8+ T cells and was required for the programming of progenitor-like CD8+ T cells.

however, using the newly established BCL6 conditional knockout mouse model, we demonstrate that BCL6 is dispensable for the maintenance of established memory CD8+ T cell pool, although BCL6 is still required for the generation of CD8+ memory precursors upon acute viral infection.

CXCR3 and its ligand CXCL9 were critical for a productive CD8+ T\240\cell response in tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1 but were not required for the infiltration of CD8+ T\240\cells into tumors.

Full activation of CD8+ T cells requires both expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (HLA-ABC) and expression of the T cell costimulatory molecule CD80 or CD86.

Generation of a CD8(+) response to extracellular antigen requires processing of the antigen by antigen presenting cells (APC) and cross-presentation to CD8(+) T cell receptors via MHC class I molecules.

Although CD8(+) T cells are shown to mediate the protective immunity against the liver stages of malaria parasites in mice, whether the direct presentation of malaria antigen by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules expressed on the liver of infected host is required for anti-plasmodial activity of CD8(+) T cells is still unknown.

There is an early (within seconds) interaction between CD3ζ and the coreceptor CD8 that is independent of the binding of CD8 to MHC, but that requires CD8 association with Lck.

Later (several minutes) CD3ζ-CD8 interactions require CD8-MHC binding.

Taken together, these findings suggest that de-sialylation of CD8 is required for hyper-responsiveness and beneficial anti-glioma activity by CD8 T cells.

Using M1- and M2-polarized macrophages from circulating monocytes, we found that M1-polarized macrophages, with significantly higher IL-12 expression and significantly lower IL-10 and MHC class II molecule expression, was more effective at promoting granzyme B responses in CD8 T cells, and required CD80/CD86 costimulating molecules for optimal responses.

We used a strategy to conditionally inactivate the genes encoding Runx1 or Runx3 at different stages of thymocyte development, demonstrating that Runx1 regulates the transitions of developing thymocytes from the CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative stage to the CD4(+) CD8(+) double-positive (DP) stage and from the DP stage to the mature single-positive stage.

Thus, our observations suggest that AML1-ETO and its splice variant AML1-ETO9a are able to regulate the expression of the CD44 gene, linking the 8.

Runx1 over-expression enhanced interferon-gamma expression via its activation and VWRPY domains, and abolished interleukin-4 expression through its activation domain.

Our data indicate that precise nucleosome positioning is not critical for the CD4 silencer function and that BAF57 participates in remodeling H1-containing chromatin at the CD4 silencer, which enables Runx1 to access the silencer and repress CD4.

We describe a sampling-based inverse prediction method for predicting time from HIV infection to attainment of the CD4 threshold and apply it to a set of treatment-naive HIV-infected subjects in a village in Botswana who participated in a household survey that collected cross-sectional CD4 counts.

CD4 is expressed in a correct orientation after its capture by CD8(+) T cells as shown by its detection using conformational antibodies and its ability to allow HIV binding on recipient CD8(+) T cells.

The expanded CD8+ population contained more cells expressing CD137 (4-1 BB), CD137 (4-1 BBL), CD30 (Ki-1), CD40 and CD134 (OX40).

Low expression of Th1-associated receptors and secretion of chemokines, together with an increased amount of CD8(+) cells expressing CD45RA and CCR7 in T1D patients therefore might represent suboptimal Th function in T1D, leading to impaired T cytotoxic responses or alternatively reflect a selective recruitment of Th1 cells into the pancreas.

Anti-HIV-1 group-specific antigen (Gag) and tetanus toxoid (TTox) function improved significantly, HIV-1-associated CD8 T-cell skewing normalized, and the percentage of late-stage and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expressing CD4 T-cells increased.

Whereas these cells express variable levels of CD8, they express uniformly high levels of CD4.

Furthermore, memory CD8+ T cells displayed an effector memory cell phenotype expressing CD45RO- CCR7- CD62L-.

whereas IFN-gamma+CD8+ memory T cells were mostly effector memory cells expressing CD45RO-CCR7-CD62L-.

However, the majority of memory CD8(+) T cells revealed effector memory phenotype expressing CD45RO(-) CCR7(-) CD62L(-).

At day 21, the most prevalent phenotype in the HLA-A2-restricted CD8+ T cell populations was CD45RA-CCR7-CD27+CD57+, whereas the HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ T cell population was predominantly CD45RA+CCR7-CD27+CD57+ Almost all TBEV epitope-specific CD8+ T cells expressed α4 and β1 integrins at days 7 and 21, whereas the bulk CD8+ T cells expressed lower integrin levels.

CD8(+) T cells from KIR3DL1 and KIR3DS1 homozygous individuals, and expressing the corresponding KIR, were enumerated and phenotyped for CD127, CD57 and CD45RA expression.

Expanding tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells in PBMCs from patients with acute hepatitis C express a CD28(+) CD45RA(-) memory T-cell phenotype.

Such CD8αα expressing T cells are an effector-memory population (CD45RA-, CCR7-, CD62L-) that express markers of activation and maturation (HLA-DR+, CD28-, CD27-, CD57+) and are functionally distinct, expressing greater levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ on stimulation and perforin at rest than their CD8α+CD8β(high) counterparts.

CD8+ TRM expressing the α1 chain (CD49a) of integrin VLA-1 have been identified within sites of resolved skin infection and in vitiligo lesions.

Loss of HDAC1 and HDAC2 during late T cell development led to the appearance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-selected CD4(+) helper T cells that expressed CD8-lineage genes such as Cd8a and Cd8b1.

Following 24 \240\weeks of antiretroviral therapy, CD8+ T cells, HLA-DR expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and non-classical monocyte percentage decreased in CSF.

Utilizing T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mouse-derived CD8+ T cells that express a TCR specific for a tumor-derived neoantigen, we showed that polyfunctional tumor-specific CTLs generated in the presence of CD4+ T cells showed long persistence in vivo and induced enhanced tumor regression when adoptively transferred into mice with progressing tumor.

The counter-ligand of VCAM-1-α4β1 integrin, also known as very late antigen-4 (VLA-4)-was more abundant on circulating CD4+ T cells and was also expressed by a significant proportion of blood CD8+ T cells and neutrophils in AD mice.

In this study, we demonstrate that suboptimal stimulation of human PBMCs with a low concentration (1 ng/ml) of staphylococcal enterotoxin C1, at which half-maximal T cell proliferation was observed, induced CD8+CD25+ T cells expressing markers related to regulatory T cells (Tregs), such as IFN-γ, IL-10, TGF-β, FOXP3, CD28, CTLA4, TNFR2, CD45RO, and HLA-DR.

A higher percentage of myeloid-derived CD45+DDR2+ cells expressed the activation markers MHC II and CD80 in both VAT and MGAT of preobese mice.

Both elicited HLA-DR, CD40, CD86 and CXCR4 upregulation, and CCR5 downregulation, but only CD40 ligand-stimulated DCs became CD83(+) \ CCR7(+), whereas poly I:C-stimulated DCs expressed lower CD83 levels and were mostly CCR7(--).

These cells were identified by coexpression of CD4 and CD123, but not CD11c, and also expressed CD83, indicating maturity of the cells.

T follicular helper cells (TFH) are prime targets of HIV infection-this creates a sanctuary for infected cells because CD8+ T cells generally do not enter lymph node follicles unless they express CXCR5, and are not as effective at killing infected CD4+ T cells as peripheral CD8+ T cells.

Approximately 3 % of peripheral CD8(+) T cells dimly express CD4 on their surface.

Functional and phenotypic characterization of virus-specific CD8 T cells against cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza (flu), and HIV-1 were performed on the basis of the ability of CD8 T cells to secrete IFN-gamma and IL-2, to proliferate, and to express CD45RA and CCR7.

Surprisingly, we found a naturally occurring, low-affinity MHC class I-restricted TCR specific for an NY-ESO-1 epitope that was unable to redirect a functional CD4 T-effector cell response could confer potent antigen-specific suppressive activity when expressed in Tregs and severely impair the expansion of highly functional HIV-1(GAG)-specific CD8 T cells expressing a high-affinity TCR.

A large proportion of Runx3 KO peripheral CD8 T cells also expressed CD4, and in contrast to wild-type, their proliferation ability was largely reduced.

In the latter subset of patients, by immunohistochemistry in lymph node lesions, we found that CD8(+) T lymphocytes intermingling with the neoplastic tissue expressed a CCR7(-) CD45RO(+)/RA(-) phenotype, whereas CD4(+) lymphocytes did not infiltrate the tumor.

CD4(+) PHA blasts express MHC class I and II, and also CD80 and CD86 and are thus expected to serve as potent antigen presenting cells.

PD-1 or TIM3-expressing CD4 + T cells and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT)-expressing CD8 + T cells in PBMCs before vaccination were negative predictive factors for survival.

This self-assembling protein nanoparticle contains five CD8+ HLA-A03-11 supertypes-restricted epitopes from antigens expressed during Toxoplasma gondii\s lifecycle, the universal CD4+ T cell epitope PADRE, and flagellin as a scaffold and TLR5 agonist.

The presence of both CD4+ T cells and antigen presenting cells (APCs) expressing high levels of HLA-B27, seems of critical importance in its pathogenesis, whereas CD8+ T cells are dispensable.

By using a novel technique to isolate primary CD4(+) T cells expressing autologous viral gene products, it was found that 1 to 13 % of CD8(+) T cells were able to respond to these cells by gamma interferon production.

CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that express CXCR3 and CCR5 and CD8+ T cells that express CDR3 and CCR4 were also enriched after treatment, indicating heightened trafficking potential in activated T cells.

Surprisingly, only purified CD8+ primary T-cells expressed PDE4B, but not CD4+ cells.

Furthermore, CXCR5+ CD8 T cells expressed CCR5 but no CCR7, suggesting a migration pattern distinct from that of follicular CD4 T cells.

Before therapy, MG patients showed reduced frequency of CD4+ T cells expressing T-helper1 (Th1) type chemokine receptor CXCR3, with a significantly lower frequency in the thymoma group than in the thymic hyperplasia group, while the frequencies of CXCR3-positive CD8+ T cells remained normal irrespective of the thymic pathology.

We found a majority of FluA-specific CD8+ T cells expressed CD27 and CD28, and variably expressed CD45RA, CD62L, CD94 and granzyme A.

Multi-color flow cytometric analysis on human CD8(+) T cell subsets revealed that CXCR4 is predominantly expressed on CD8(+) T cells with the naive CD27(+) CD28(+) CD45RA(+) phenotype, and is down-regulated during differentiation into those with an effector phenotype.

The number of CD4 T cells and CD14 monocytes expressing CCR3 (p = 0.013, p = 0.009, respectively) and CD8 T cells expressing CCR5 (p = 0.04) as well as PHA stimulated secretion of IL4 and IFNgamma (p&lt.

Remarkably, the majority of resting and activated macaque NKT cells expressed CD8, and a smaller portion expressed CD4.

Aggregate results in primary cells from up to 4 different blood or skin donors showed that viruses with envelopes from the transmitting partner as compared to recipient envelopes replicated more efficiently in CD4+ T cells, monocyte derived dendritic cell (MDDC)-CD4+ T cell co-cultures, Langerhans cells (LCs)-CD4+ T cell co-cultures and CD4+ T cells expressing high levels of the gut homing receptor, α4β7, and demonstrated greater binding to α4β7 high/CD8+ T cells.

Interestingly, few PD-1(+) CD8(+) T cells expressed CCR7 compared to PD-1(+) CD4 T cells and PD-1(-) T cells.

Consistent with a T(EM) phenotype, CD45RO(high) CD57(+) CD8(high) T cells express higher levels of granzyme A, granzyme B, perforin, CCR5 and α4β7, and lower levels of CCR7 and CD28 than other CD8(high) T cells.

In the brains of JEV-infected mice, infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed CCR2 and CCR5 and were found to comprise mainly effector T cells (CD44+CD62L-).

These findings show that activated CD4(+) T cells expressing NKG2DLs can efficiently prevent NKG2D-mediated CD8(+) T-cell functions, and suggest that the NKG2D/NKG2DL interaction can regulate immune responses.

The majority of CD8 T-cells from subjects with latent infection expressed a terminally-differentiated phenotype (CD45RA+CCR7(-)).

B7 EBV-encoded nuclear Ag (EBNA)-3 A-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed only CD45RO from acute through latent EBV infection.

A2 BMLF-1-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed CD45RO during acute infection and either CD45RA or CD45RO during latent EBV infection.

In individuals with latent EBV infection, the frequencies of A2 BMLF-1- or B7 EBNA-3A-specific CD8(+) T cells that expressed CD45RA, CD45RO, CD62 ligand, CCR7, and perforin were stable over time.

Such CD8αα expressing T cells are an effector-memory population (CD45RA-, CCR7-, CD62L-) that express markers of activation and maturation (HLA-DR+, CD28-, CD27-, CD57+) and are functionally distinct expressing greater levels of TNF-α and IFN-γ on stimulation and perforin at rest than their CD8α+CD8β(high) counterparts.

In contrast, dual-costimulated CD4 T cells express Eomes, despite the continued expression of ThPOK and the absence of CD8α, indicating that Eomes is selectively released from ThPOK repression.

We observed that intra-melanoma DP T cells were transcriptome-wise closer to their CD8 SP T-cell counterparts in terms of number of genes differentially expressed (97 in common with CD8 SP T cells and 15 with CD4 SP T cells) but presented hallmarks of a transition to a CD4-like functional profile (CD40LG) with a decreased cytotoxic signature (KLRC1) in favour of an increased cytokine-receptor interaction signature (IL4, IL24, IL17A…).

PD-1+ CXCR5+ CD4 T cells were functional, could express IL-21, IL-10, and CXCL13 upon stimulation, demonstrated auxiliary effects toward CD8 T cell-mediated IFN-γ production and proliferation, and promoted IgM and IgG production.

Most ALCL cases express CD4, but a small subset of ALCL cases has been reported to express CD8.

CD4(+) T cells express IL-2 receptor complexes to the same level as CD8(+) T cells when the two T cell populations were stimulated simultaneously.

Type 1 myeloid (CD11c(+), CD11b(+), B220(-), CD8alpha(-)) DC made up the largest (40-45 %) population and all DC expressed low levels of CD80, CD86, and CD40, and had high endocytic activity consistent with an immature phenotype.

Besides CD4+ T cells, a small portion of CXCR5 expressing CD8+ T cells, regarded as follicular cytotoxic T cells (Tfc), could migrate into B cell follicles during chronic viral infection and several types of cancers, and this population exhibit lower level of exhaustion than its CXCR5- counterparts.

Notably, we did observe enhanced proportions of CD4 T cells expressing HLA-DR, PD-1 (at 2 weeks after onset of treatment) and ICOS (6 weeks) and a CD8 T cell population expressing LAG3 (2 weeks).

We also demonstrate that VC CD8+ T cells inhibit virus replication in both a class I- and class II-dependent manner, and that in two VC patients the class II-restricted CD8+ T cells with an anti-viral gene signature expressed both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lineage-specific genes.

HIV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing cytokines waned in peripheral blood lymphocytes by day 84, but CD8+ T cell responses to F4 peptides could still be detected in lymphoid tissues more than 3 months after vaccination.

To determine whether CD8 independent tumor cell recognition is a property of the TCR, we used retroviral transduction to express the TIL 1383 I TCR in the CD8(-) murine lymphoma, 58 alpha(-)/beta(-).

1) complexes comprising residues 81-88 of the human homolog of the murine double-minute 2 oncoprotein, MDM2(81-88), we found that the heterodimeric CD8 alpha beta coreceptor, but not normally expressed homodimeric CD8 alpha alpha, is required for tetramer binding and functional redirection of TCR- transduced human T cells.

However, a significantly higher proportion of VLE-specific CD8 T cells expressed perforin compared to NLV-specific CD8 T cells in HIV patients.

The cytotoxic function of p113-121/HLA-A,0201-specific CD8(+) T cells extended into direct killing of splenocytes infected with live Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing ML1419c: both 9 mer and 30 mer induced CD8(+) T cells that reduced the number of ML1419c-expressing mycobacteria by 95 %, whereas no reduction occurred using wild-type M.

The overall breadth and magnitude of HIV-1-specific CD8(+) T cell responses were lower in persons expressing B,5802, and epitope presentation by B,5802 contributed significantly less to the overall response as compared to B,5801-restricted CD8 (+) T cells.

In this study, we transduced L1210 leukemia cells with a lentiviral vector encoding two B7 costimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) and obtained LEXs that highly expressed CD80 and CD86.

The expression and function of CCR6 on human CD8+ T cells have not well been analyzed, although it is known that this receptor is expressed on a subset of human CD8+ T cells.

As CXCR3high memory CD8+ T cells do not express CCR5, high expression of CXCR3 on these memory CD8+ T cells might play an important role in the migration of these cells to inflammatory sites and in their differentiation.

Epstein Barr virus-specific CD8(+) T cells, which mostly express the memory phenotype expressed CXCR4, while human cytomegalovirus-specific CD8(+) T cells, which mostly express the effector phenotype, partially expressed this receptor, showing that the expression of CXCR4 is also down-regulated during differentiation of viral antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells.

In contrast, percentages of CD3+/CD8+ memory lymphocytes expressing CX3CR1 were significantly less than percentages of naive CD3+/CD8+ lymphocytes in RA PB, suggesting that this receptor may be down-regulated upon lymphocyte activation.

Both HIV- and CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells in GALT expressed CCR5, but only HIV-specific CD8(+) T cells expressed alpha E beta 7 integrin, suggesting that mucosal priming may account for their retention in GALT.

Freshly isolated CD8alpha+CD11c-Lin- cells expressed CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 2, CCR5, and CCR7 messenger RNA, whereas CD8alpha+ DCs derived from CD8alpha+CD11c-Lin- cells further obtained the expression of CCR6 and macrophage-derived chemokine.

Preferential residence of WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells in BM could be, at least in part, explained by higher expression of chemokine receptor CCR5, whose ligand was expressed on BM fibroblasts on the WT1-specific CD8(+) T cells in BM, compared to those in PB.

CCR4(+) CD8(+) T cells expressed neither perforin (Per) nor granzymes (Gra) A/B, suggesting that they were more immature memory T cells than the CCR6(+) CD8(+) early effector memory T cells that express GraA and Per.

We characterized CD8 T cells derived from organ donors and patients with end-stage HCV infection to show that: 1) all liver-infiltrating CD8 T cells express high levels of CD11a, indicating the effective absence of naive CD8 T cells in the liver.

Here we show that the frequency of CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory killer cell lectin-like receptor G1 (KLRG1), a marker of cells unable to undergo further clonal expansion, was markedly elevated in CD8+ T cells from old donors.

However, we also report that HLA-B(∗) 7/TPR specific CD8(+) T cells express higher levels of PD-1 than HLA-A(∗) 2/NLV specific cells and HLA-A(∗) 2 individuals show a higher proliferative response to PD-L blockade, than HLA-B(∗) 7 individuals, which we postulate may be due to the differing functional avidities for these two CMV-specific CD8(+) T cells populations.

In contrast, within weeks following active SIV infection, SIV-specific CD8(+) effector T-cells expressed fewer cytokines/degranulation markers and had a lower avidity compared to influenza specific CD8(+) T-cells.

In parallel, Melan-A-specific CD8+ T cells and clones from low peptide dose-vaccinated patients expressed lower CD8 levels, despite similar or even stronger binding to tetramers.

Interestingly, the percentage of HTLV-1 Tax301-309/HLA-A,2402 tetramer(+) CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1 in ACs was significantly higher than the percentage of HTLV-1 Tax11-19/HLA-A,0201 tetramer(+) CD8(+) cells expressing PD-1.

The results also showed that most CMV pp65-specific CD8 T cells in elderly individuals were CD27/CD28 negative and expressed CD85j and CD244.

HDV-specific CD8+ T cells did not express the terminal differentiation marker CD57, and fewer HDV-specific than Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD8+ T cells were 2 B4+CD160+PD1+, a characteristic of exhausted cells.

Immunity-associated genes including those related to effector memory CD8 T cells were dominantly expressed in tumors with low neoAg frequencies in stage I-II patients, suggesting CD8 T cell-mediated elimination of immunogenic sub-clones expressing neoantigens (immunoediting) had occurred.

Because CD8(+) T cells restrict HIV replication, depend upon HLA class I antigen presentation and can also express KIR molecules, we investigated how these HLA/KIR combinations relate to the phenotype and function of CD8(+) T cells from uninfected controls and individuals with chronic HIV infection.

In healthy controls CD8αα is most highly expressed by CD161 " bright" (CD161++) mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, with CD8αα expression highly restricted to the TCR Vα7.

Overall we have clearly defined CD8αα expressing human T cell subsets using the TL-tetramer, and have demonstrated CD161-CD8α+CD8β(low) populations, highly expanded in disease settings, to co-express CD8αβ and CD8αα.

While CD8αβ heterodimer is expressed exclusively on CD8+ T cells, the CD8αα homodimer is present in subsets of T cells and human natural killer (NK) cells.

Effector memory CD8+ T cells generally expressed TOX, whereas naive and early-differentiated memory CD8+ T cells generally expressed TCF-1.

Further transcriptomic analyses demonstrated that CD69+CD26++ CD8+MAIT cells highly expressed numerous genes for mediating anti-mycobacterial immune responses, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, cytolytic molecules, NK cell receptors, and transcription factors, in contrast to inactivated counterparts CD69+/-CD26+/- CD8+MAIT cells.

Unlike wild-type IL-18, DR-18 exerted potent anti-tumour effects in mouse tumour models by promoting the development of poly-functional effector CD8+ T cells, decreasing the prevalence of exhausted CD8+ T cells that express the transcriptional regulator of exhaustion TOX, and expanding the pool of stem-like TCF1+ precursor CD8+ T cells.

Consistent with the TRM cell phenotype, CD8+ TILs minimally expressed CX3CR1 but expressed CXCR3 at higher levels than circulating CD8+ T cells.

In vitro, proliferating CD8 T cells express PD-L1 suggesting that anti-PD-L1 treatment also targets virus-specific CD8 T cells.

Transfer of cultured Chlamydia-specific CD8(+) T cells or vaccination with recombinant virus expressing an MHC I-restricted Chlamydia Ag confers protection, yet surprisingly a protective CD8(+) T cell response is not stimulated following natural infection.

We utilized two models of CD8+ T cell mediated immunity: a mouse model of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection in which CD8+ T cells specific for LM expressed antigens (Listeriolysin O, LLO) can be tracked, and a murine skin graft model in which CD8+ T cells mediate rejection across a MHC class I (D(d)) disparity.

During the interaction with CD8+ T-cells, AA MCs prominently expressed MHC class I and OX40L, and sometimes 4-1 BBL or ICAM-1, suggesting that MC may present autoantigens to CD8+ T-cells and/or co-stimulatory signals.

To determine the clinical features of myositis patients with the histopathologic finding of CD8-positive T cells invading non-necrotic muscle fibers expressing major histocompatibility complex class 1 (CD8-MHC-1 complex), which is shared by polymyositis (PM) and inclusion body myositis (IBM), in relation to the p62 immunostaining pattern of muscle fibers.

Here, by evaluating CD8 T cell responses in CB6F1 hybrid mice, in which multiple epitopes are recognized, we found that a numerically subdominant CD8 T cell response against DbM187 epitope of the virus matrix protein expressed high avidity TCR and enhanced signaling pathways associated with CD8 T cell effector functions.

Using both ELISpot methodology and intracellular cytokine staining for interferon (IFN)-gamma to assess functional status, together with fluorochrome-labeled peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) class I tetramer analysis to detect the physical presence of CD8+ T lymphocytes expressing cognate T-cell receptors (TCRs), we observed that the proportion of HIV-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes capable of mounting an effector response to antigen challenge directly ex vivo is related to the kinetics of virus exposure.

The great majority of these influenza-specific CD8(+) IFN-gamma(+) T cells neither stained with the cognate tetramer nor expressed the TCR Vbeta bias that is characteristic of the CD8(+) set expanded in vivo during an infection.

This antagonism is observed both in vitro and in vivo, is transcriptional, and requires domains of Zbtb7b that are essential to its ability to promote CD4 differentiation in vivo.

A binding assay using the three Impα isoforms showed that Vpr bound preferentially to the ninth armadillo repeat (ARM) region (which is also essential for the binding of CAS, the export receptor for Impα) in all three isoforms.

Comparison of the importin-α- and actin-complexes revealed that the binding of G-actins to MAL is associated with folding of NLS residues into a helical conformation that is inappropriate for importin-α recognition.

Crystallographic analysis of mammalian importin α1 in complex with the hPLSCR4-NLS reveals this minimal NLS binds specifically and exclusively to the minor binding site of importin α.

Furthermore, mutations affecting RanBP5 binding are incompatible with or severely attenuate viral growth, providing further support for a key role for RanBP5 in the influenza A virus life cycle.

In vitro binding assays indicated that importin α interacted with the zinc finger domain of Snail to compete with the binding of importin β1 and that Snail did not form a ternary complex with importin α/importin β1.

To investigate the effects of adaptive mutations on importin interaction and selectivity, surface plasmon resonance was used to compare the binding rate constants and affinities of avian H5N1 and human H3N2 PB2 C-terminal variants with importin isoforms human α 1, 3, 5 and 7, and avian α 1.

The crystal structure of MOF NLSs in complex with importin α1 further revealed a unique binding mode of MOF, with two independent NLSs binding to importin α1 major and minor sites, respectively.

Further, we have identified a high-affinity microtubule-binding region that lies carboxyl-terminal to the NLS, which is sterically masked by Importin-β on being bound by Importin-α.

Atomic structures of importin α bound to two variants of NLS2 revealed NLS2 primarily binds the major-NLS binding site of importin α, unlike NLS1 that associates with the minor NLS-pocket.

The structure reveals that RanBP3 binds to importin-α3 residues that are strictly conserved in all seven isoforms of human importin-α at the major NLS-binding site, indicating that the region of importin-α outside the NLS-binding site, possibly the autoinhibotory importin-β1-binding domain, may be the key determinant for the preferential binding of RanBP3 to importin-α3.

The structures show that EBNA1 NLS binds to the major and minor NLS-binding sites of importin-α1, and indicate that the binding affinity of the EBNA1 NLS to the minor NLS-binding site could be enhanced by phosphorylation of S385 through electrostatic interaction between the phosphate group of phospho-S385 and K392 of importin-α1 (corresponding to R395 of importin-α5) on armadillo repeat 8.

Based on our quantitative experimental data, we pursue NF-κB system modelling by explicitly including NF-κB-importin and IκBα-exportin binding to show that the competition between importins and IκBα enables NF-κB nuclear translocation despite high levels of IκBα.

We further characterised the interaction between the NLS and Importin-α using complementary biophysical techniques and have determined the 2.4 Å resolution crystal structure of the HNF1β NLS peptide bound to Importin-α.

We identified Importin-α1 to bind to AnkG, but not to the mutants and concluded that binding of AnkG to p32 and Importin-α1 is essential for migration into the nucleus.

Consistent with this, molecular binding and transport assays indicate that the P-CTD mediates IMPα2/IMPβ1-dependent nuclear import by conferring direct binding to the IMPα2/IMPβ1 heterodimer, as well as to a truncated form of IMPα2 lacking the IMPβ-binding autoinhibitory domain (ΔIBB-IMPα2), and IMPβ1 alone.

More particularly, importin α1 bound directly to FGF1 and FGF2, secreted cNLS-containing growth factors, and addition of exogenous importin α1 enhanced the activation of ERK1/2, downstream targets of FGF1 signalling, in FGF1-stimulated cancer cells.

RBBP4 accelerates the release of importin β1 from importin α via competitive binding to the importin β-binding domain of importin α in the presence of RanGTP.

This is the first report to identify a factor that competes with importin β1 to bind to importin α, and it demonstrates that the loss of this factor can trigger cellular senescence.

We predict that the stepwise dissociation of the NLS from Impα facilitates unloading by providing a partially complexed intermediate that is available for competitive binding by Nup50 or the Importin β binding domain.

We discovered that importin α also binds to the primary binding site of the 14-3-3 proteins with high affinity, which suggests that both importin α and 14-3-3 are each competing with the other for this broad-binding region (residues 117-196) on ChREBP.

We establish for the first time that ivermectin can dissociate the preformed IMPα/β1 heterodimer, as well as prevent its formation, through binding to the IMPα armadillo (ARM) repeat domain to impact IMPα thermal stability and α-helicity.

The NIT-2 NLS sequence binds with high affinity to the Impα major binding site from both organisms, but its binding to minor binding sites reveals interesting differences due to the presence of additional interactions of NIT-2-NLS with MmImpα.

It remains unknown if either proinflammatory stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs), ferried to nucleus by importin α5, or lipid-regulating sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), transported to the nucleus by importin β1, mediate endotoxin shock.

Mutational analysis indicates that the mitotic phosphorylation of importin-α1 inhibits its binding to importin-β and promotes the release of TPX2 and KIFC1, which are then targeted like importin-β to the spindle.

Strikingly, GW5074 not only inhibits IMPα binding to IMPβ1, but can dissociate preformed IMPα/β1 heterodimer, through targeting the IMPα armadillo (ARM) repeat domain to impact IMPα thermal stability and α-helicity, as shown using analytical ultracentrifugation, thermostability analysis and circular dichroism measurements.

We report that in co-immunoprecipitation assays PARP2 interacts with several isoforms of the importin-α group of nuclear transport adapters and that PARP2 binding to IMPORTIN-α2 is mediated by the identified nuclear localization sequence.

NLS identifications are based on Importin α (Impα) binding affinity determined by fluorescence polarization of fluorescein-labeled NLS peptides, X-ray crystallographic analysis of the Impα∆IBB•NLS complexes and fluorescence-based subcellular localization studies.

We thus focused on importin β1 as a binding partner of NORAD and found that knockdown of NORAD partially inhibits the physical interaction of importin β1 with Smad3, inhibiting the nuclear accumulation of Smad complexes in response to TGF-β.

Interestingly, importin α5 was verified to interact with M protein through binding importin β1.

We determined the crystal structure of the C-terminal region of Importin4 bound to the histone H3 peptide, thus revealing that the acidic patch in Importin4 accommodates the histone H3 tail, and that histone H3 Lys14 contributes to the interaction with Importin4.

Molecular docking simulations of TP2(NLS) with the importin-4 structure led to the identification of a TP2(NLS) binding pocket spanning the three helices (helices 21 to 23) of importin-4, which was experimentally confirmed by in vitro interaction and import studies with different deletion mutants of importin-4.

RanBP5 binds to RanBP1 as part of a trimeric RanBP1-Ran-RanBP5 complex.

Importin-alpha contains the NLS binding site, whereas importin-beta mediates the translocation through the nuclear pore.

Moreover, in living cells, the full-length U1A accumulated in the nucleus in a Ran-dependent manner, and nuclear accumulation was inhibited by the importin beta binding domain of importin alpha.

The presence of an importin-beta N-terminal domain at their N-terminus, their size of approximately 110 kD, their nuclear localization and the identity of the homologue to a gene of a recently submitted RanGTP binding protein (RanBP16), suggest that its protein is a novel member of the importin-beta superfamily of nuclear transport receptors, therefore called RanBP17.

We have previously shown that GAL4 is recognised with high affinity by importin beta and not by the conventional nuclear localisation sequence binding importin alpha subunit of the importin alpha/beta heterodimer.

The alpha-subunit of the complex (importin-alpha) binds to the NLS and the beta-subunit (importin-beta) carries the alpha-subunit, bound to the NLS substrate, into the nucleus.

The rice importin alpha1 showed specific binding to fusion proteins containing either monopartite or bipartite NLSs, but not to a fusion protein containing a Matalpha-2-type NLS, suggesting that there exists selective binding of rice importin alpha1 to different plant NLSs.

Nuclear import of proteins containing classical nuclear localization signals (NLS) is mediated by the importin-alpha:beta complex that binds cargo in the cytoplasm and facilitates its passage through nuclear pores, after which nuclear RanGTP dissociates the import complex and the importins are recycled.

The crystal structure of the importin-alpha:Nup50 complex shows that Nup50 binds at two sites on importin-alpha.

Furthermore, we show that PLSCR1 is specifically transported into the nucleus by the importin alpha/beta import pathway, and binds directly and with high affinity to importin alpha.

Importin alpha binds directly NLS and functions as an adapter for accessing the importin beta-dependent import pathway.

Importin alpha binds to importin beta, which docks the protein complex to nuclear pores, and the complex translocates into the nucleus.

Four XY gonadal dysgenesis patients with mutations in SRY NLS regions showed reduced nuclear import accompanied in some cases by reduced importin beta recognition.

We describe a novel double-fluorescent label DNA binding assay to demonstrate mutual exclusivity between importin beta recognition and DNA binding on the part of SRY, which may represent an alternative release mechanism upon nuclear entry.

The high-mobility group domain of human SRY contains two independent nuclear localization signals, one bound by calmodulin (CaM) and the other by importin-β.

Clinical SRY and SOX9 mutations causing disorders of sex development (DSD) highlight defective protein-protein interactions between SRY or SOX9, and carrier proteins required for nuclear import (importin-b and calmodulin) and nuclear export (CRM-1).

HLA-CW1 heavy chains, when free of beta 2 m, are less soluble in the detergent TX-114 than free HLA-B27 heavy chains, and when associated with beta 2 m share an alpha 3 domain epitope with free HLA-A2 and-B27 heavy chains.

When appropriate peptides were added to cultured cells or in cell lysates significant amounts of conformed HLA-C molecules that associate with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2 m) are detected, but are indeed not sufficient to restore expression to the level observed for HLA-A or-B molecules.

We find that intrinsic properties of the HLA-C heavy chain proteins do not correlate with low cell surface expression: HLA-C heavy chains associate and dissociate with beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2 m) at rates comparable to those found for HLA-A and-B, and increased competition for beta 2 m does not alter the surface expression of HLA-C.

Seven correlated with HLA-A locus substitutions (Glu-62/Gly-65, Lys-66, Arg-114, His-114/Tyr-116/Lys-127, Thr-142/His-145 [ x2], and Thr-149), two with HLA-B locus substitutions (Thr-24, Ser-24) and three with interlocus antibodies associated with either HLA-A and B (Leu-82/Arg-83 [ x2]) or with HLA-B and-C substitutions (Leu-163).

It appears that HLA-C H chains are initially synthesized in amounts similar to HLA-A and B H chains, but associate inefficiently with beta 2-microglobulin, resulting in low expression of HLA-C at the cell surface.

We further identified multiple independent new susceptibility loci in HLA-C, HLA-B, HLA-DPB1 and BTNL2 and an intergenic variant, rs118179173 associated with psoriasis and confirmed the well-established risk allele HLA-C,06:02.

While several SNPs in the MHC region were individually associated with KD susceptibility, we report over-transmission of HLA-C,15 (z = + 2.19, P = 0.03) and under-transmission of HLA-B,44 (z =-2.49, P = 0.01) alleles from parents to patients with KD.

HLA-B,44 has been associated with KD in other smaller studies, and both HLA-C,15 and HLA-B,44 have biological mechanisms that could potentially be involved in KD pathogenesis.

Likewise, the association of ERAP1 with other MHC-I associated disorders and its epistasis with their susceptibility MHC alleles point out to a general role of the MHC-I peptidome in these diseases.

We identified five putative epitopes with associations to HLA-I alleles including HLA,B-2705 and HLA-B,5101 (associated with slow disease progression and low viral set point) and HLA-B,18 (associated with rapid disease progression and high viral set point).

More importantly we find that rs9468925 in HLA-C/HLA-B is associated with both psoriasis and vitiligo, providing first important evidence that two major skin diseases share a common genetic locus in the MHC, and a basis for elucidating the molecular mechanism of skin disorders.

However, recent genome-wide association studies have confirmed that HLA-B,51 is primarily associated with BD and that there are multiple susceptibility loci other than HLA-B,51.

A cDNA clone derived from the HLA-C gene with a blank specificity (Cx52) strongly associated with the most common haplotype in a Japanese population, A24-CwBL-B52-DR2-DQ6-DP9, has been recently cloned and sequenced in our laboratory and officially designated Cw,1201 as an allelic name, indicating that the inability to define the HLA-C antigen serologically in this haplotype is not due to an HLA-C antigen gene deletion or mutation, but to the absence of typing sera.

Nascent MHC class II molecules are associated with the invariant chain and are transported to the endolysosomal pathway, where MHC class II molecules acquire peptide antigens.

A recently identified genetic polymorphism located in the 5 \ region of the HLA-C gene is associated with individual variations in HIV-1 viral load and with differences in HLA-C expression levels.

Thus the " footprint" of the NKIR on the alpha1 helix of the class I MHC molecule HLA-C and its associated beta strands are similar in position to the site occupied by superantigens on and behind the alpha1 helix of the class II MHC molecule HLA-DR1, but further toward its C-terminus.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 35 kb upstream of the HLA-C gene is associated with HLA-C expression, and the high expressing genotype (CC) has been associated with HIV-I control.

The exercise program induced a IIx to IIa MHC shift that was associated with a corresponding increase in transcription on the antisense strand of the IIx MHC gene and a decrease in antisense transcription of the IIa MHC gene, suggesting an inhibitory mechanism mediated by NATs.

We also report that the absence of expression of IIb MHC in human limb muscle is associated with the abundant expression of antisense transcript overlapping the IIb MHC coding gene, which is the opposite expression pattern as compared with that previously observed in rats.

These include pathogen-driven selection for antigen-binding breadth and expansion of the MHC gene family associated autoimmunity trade-offs, hitchhiking of deleterious mutations linked to the MHC, geographic subdivision, and adaptive introgression.

By contrast, an unrelated, non-antigenic peptide presented by the same MHC molecule does not form a catch bond, instead manifesting a slip bond associated with rapid TCR-pMHC dissociation.

Objectives: To test the hypothesis that familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)-associated autoinflammation may exaggerate the tendency toward adaptive immunopathology or spondyloarthritis (SpA)-associated disorders including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I associated disorders but not classical MHC class II-associated disorders that exhibit transplacental autoimmunity including myasthenia gravis and pemphigus.

In contrast, in women, the PPARGC1A rs8192678 A/A genotype was significantly associated with a higher proportion of MHC-I (p = 0.042) and with a lower proportion of MHC-IIx (p = 0.033), and the NRF1 rs6949152 AA genotype was significantly associated with a higher proportion of MHC-I (p = 0.008) and with a lower proportion of MHC IIx (p = 0.035).

Expression of the MHC class IIβ locus previously associated with Bd disease outcomes was a significant predictor of Bd infection intensity at early infection stages but not at late infection stages, suggesting initial MHC-linked immune processes are important for ultimate disease outcomes.

abortus was not only able to reduce the expression of mature MHC-II, but it also inhibited the expression of invariant chain (Ii)-associated immature MHC-II molecules.

2 (+) regulatory T cells from conventional T cells and also distinguished CD4(+) T cells selected by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule I-A(g7) (associated with the development of type 1 diabetes in NOD mice) from those selected by a non-autoimmunity-promoting MHC class II molecule I-A(b).

In a set of primary melanoma cell populations and correspondingly expanded autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL), we show how MHC class II expression on melanoma cells associates with strong MHC class II-restricted CD4(+) T-cell responses that are specific for tumors.

Public CDR3 sequences are shared between mice of different MHC haplotypes, but are associated with different, MHC-dependent, V genes.

Epigenetic and genetic alterations in cancers, including promoter methylation, copy number loss, and somatic mutations, were most prevalent in NLRC5 among all MHC class I-related genes and were associated with the impaired expression of components of the MHC class I pathway.

Mutations in Gag epitopes presented by protective MHC-I alleles are associated with significantly higher fitness cost and lower reductions in binding affinity with respect to MHC-I.

We show here for the first time that HLA-B,1503 is associated significantly with poor prognosis after HIV-2 infection and that HLA-B,0801 is associated with susceptibility to infection.

Thus, the present study excluded the possibility that the disability of the presentation of HIV-1 epitopes by HLA-B35 molecules is associated with the accelerated progression of AIDS in HLA-B35-positive individuals.

The risk profile of polymorphisms at position 97 of HLA-B are more broadly associated with HIV-1 viral load during primary infection and may serve as a focal point in further studies of HLA-B function.

HLA-B,27:05 is one of the widely reported alleles associated with resistance to HIV, while HLA-A24, HLA-B7, HLA-B,07:02, HLA-B,35:01, HLA-B,53:01, and HLA-B40 are reported to be associated with susceptibility to HIV.

In the present study we demonstrate that SIVcpz and HIV-1 group N or O nef alleles down-modulate CD4, CD28, and class I or II MHC molecules and up-regulate surface expression of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Nef from laboratory strains down-modulates cell surface expression of mature major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules, while up-regulating surface expression of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II (P.

WNV-induced up-regulation of cell surface MHC-I expression is associated with NF-kappaB activation and increased transcription of MHC-I mRNA.

Upon the development of MHC/peptide binding assays and definition of its associated motif, we revealed that this allele shares peptide binding characteristics with the HLA-B7 supertype, the most frequent supertype in human populations.

We found that nef alleles from all SIVsmm lineages down-modulated CD4, MHC-I, CD28 and CD3 and up-regulated the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II molecules in human-derived cells.

Moreover, we find that chimpanzee and human MHC associated with low viral load are predicted to elicit broader Gag-specific immune responses than human MHC associated with high viral load, thus supporting earlier findings that Gag-specific immune responses are essential for HIV-1 control.

To evaluate whether nef alleles derived from perinatally HIV-1-infected children showing no, slow or rapid disease progression differ in their abilities to downmodulate mature MHC-II or to upregulate the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II complexes.

The main processing pathway for MHC class I ligands involves degradation of proteins by the proteasome, followed by transport of products by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where peptides are bound by MHC class I molecules, and then presented on the cell surface by MHCs.

Addressing this, we demonstrate that, similarly to the SIVmac239 nef, primary SIVsm and HIV-2 nef alleles down-modulate cell surface expression of human CD4, CD28, CD3, and class I or II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I or MHC-II, respectively) molecules, up-regulate surface expression of the invariant chain (Ii) associated with immature MHC-II, inhibit early T-cell activation events, and enhance virion infectivity.

MICA is highly polymorphic in sequence which leads to MICA protein variants with distinct features.

Thus, the influence of ERAP1 on HLA-B,27 is very diverse at the population level, because of the multiplicity and complexity of ERAP1 variants, and to the distinct effects of their co-occurring polymorphisms leading to significant modulation of disease risk among HLA-B,27-positive individuals.

HLA-B∗27 heavy chain (B27-HC) has an intrinsic propensity to fold slowly leading to the accumulation of the misfolded B27-HC in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and formation of the HLA-B∗27 HC homodimer, (B27-HC) 2, by a disulfide linkage at Cys-67.

Although there is X-ray crystallographic evidence that the interaction between major histocompatibility complex (MHC, in humans HLA) class I molecules and T cell receptors (TCR) or killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR) may be accompanied by considerable changes in the conformation of selected residues or even entire loops within TCR or KIR, conformational changes between receptor-bound and-unbound MHC class I molecules of comparable magnitude have not been observed so far.

Since previous studies showed that some HLA-B51 alloreactive CTL clones failed to kill the cells expressing HLA-B,5102 or HLA-B,5103, these results imply that the structural change of the A-pocket among HLA-B51 subtypes causes a critical conformational change of the epitope for TCR recognition rather than influences the interaction between peptides and MHC class I molecules.

Whereas escape mutations that affect MHC binding are typically no longer under selection pressure in the next host of the virus (as hosts differ in their MHC alleles), escape mutations that affect the antigen processing of epitope precursors prevent the use of those epitope precursors by any of the MHC alleles in a host population.

We find that mutations which impair binding to HLA-A molecules tend to have lower in vitro replicative fitness than mutations which do not impair binding to HLA-A molecules, suggesting that HLA-A escape mutations carry higher fitness costs than non-escape mutations.

Immunization of transgenic HLA-A,02:01/HLA-DRB1,01:01 mice with four of these double binding peptides gave rise to both HLA class I and class II restricted responses by CD8 and CD4 T cells, respectively, whereas four of the double binding peptides did result in HLA-A,02:01 restricted responses only.

Anti-mp30 specific T cells generated in HLA-A,0201 transgenic mice were dependent on TCR-CD8/MHC-I alpha3 binding and therefore not capable of recognizing mp30-pulsed human HLA-A,0201(+) cells or murine HLA-A,0201 transfectants.

In this study, we examined whether or not these peptides can induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in HLA-A11+ or HLA-A31+ epithelial cancer patients because the HLA-A11, HLA-A31, and HLA-A33 alleles share binding motifs as an HLA-A3 supertype family, which is widely distributed in many ethnic populations.

Thirteen of the 15 peptides exhibited high or medium binding affinities for HLA-A,0201 molecules, indicating that the high binding affinity for MHC class I molecules is an important factor for immunogenicity.

trachomatis-specific HLA-A2 peptide tetramers were able to bind T cells with receptors from subjects which were restricted by either the HLA-A2 or the HLA-A28 restriction element.

On the basis of this analysis, 18 individual HLA-A2 mutants were generated and the ability of full-length US2 to bind wild-type and mutated HLA-A2 complexes was assessed.

The structural comparison of all known crystal structures of HLA-A2 either alone, or in complex with T cell receptor or the CD8 co-receptor, indicates that binding of US2 to HLA-A2 results in a unique, large conformational change of the side chain of Arg181.

However, although the presence of Arg181 seems to be a prerequisite for US2 binding to HLA-A2, it is not sufficient for binding to all MHC class I alleles.

The HLA-A11, HLA-A31, and HLA-A33 alleles share binding motifs and belong to an HLA-A3 supertype family.

Scanning of HIV-1 clade B SF2 strain proteins for the presence of peptides containing HLA-A,3101-binding motifs revealed 88 nine- to 11-mer peptides that had been synthesized and assayed for binding to HLA-A,3101 molecules.

Peptide-specific allorecognition was examined using tetramers of HLA-A,0201 representing five peptides derived from ubiquitously expressed self-proteins that are known to bind endogenously to HLA-A,0201.

To identify HLA-A24-restricted T-cell epitopes of Livin/ML-IAP, eight peptides were selected from the amino acid sequence of this protein and screened for their binding affinity to HLA-A24.

Mutations of the coding region of the HLA-A2 binding Melan-A26-35 peptide or down-regulation of the MHC class I heavy chain, the antigenic peptide TAP, and tapasin could be excluded.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were stimulated in vitro with each of three different PSCA-derived peptides, which were prepared based on the HLA-A24 binding motif, and their peptide-specific and HLA-A24-restricted anti-tumor responses were examined.

The HLA-A11,-A31, and-A33 alleles share similar binding motifs with HLA-A3 and-A68 alleles, and, thus, are classified as an HLA-A3 supertype.

Peptides bearing the HLA-A,0201-specific anchor motifs were analyzed for their capacity to bind and stabilize the HLA-A,0201 molecules.

To study the specific CD8(+) T cell response to HLA-A2 binding peptide Flu p58-66 from HLA-A2-positive hepatocellular carcinoma patients and healthy donors.

Although the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is very polymorphic, several alleles of HLA loci share key residues at anchor positions in the peptide binding pockets such that similar peptides may be presented by different MHC molecules encoded by the same locus.

Likewise, using bioinformatic tools in silico, we identified CD8 T-cell specificity or reactivity against HLA-A,02:01 binding peptides wt p53(65-73), wt p53(187-197), and wt p53(264-272) in breast cancer patients and against HLA-A,01:01 binding peptide wt p53(226-234) and HLA-B,07:02 binding peptide wt p53(74-82) in renal cell cancer and breast cancer patients, respectively.

HLA-A2-restricted epitopes were identified based on their in vitro binding affinity for HLA-A2 and by the ability of a genetic vaccine to elicit peptide-specific CTL in A2/DR1 (HLA-A2.

This method utilizes the information from both the crystal structures and experimental affinities of various peptides bound with HLA-A,0201 to construct a single-position mutation free energy profile for accurately characterizing HLA-A,0201-peptide interaction and for effectively predicting the binding affinities of peptides to HLA-A,0201.

We employ this method to analyze physicochemical properties and structural implication underlying the specific recognition and association between the HLA-A,0201 and a large panel of peptide segments generated from the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome, and to evaluate the binding potencies of these peptide candidates to HLA-A,0201.

Specific amino acids in the HLA-B peptide binding groove, as well as an independent HLA-C effect, explain the SNP associations and reconcile both protective and risk HLA alleles.

In this report we demonstrate an HLA-A,0201 restricted CMV-specific CD8 T-cell response (designated YVL) that represents several percent of the CD8 T-cell subset, yet fails to bind tetrameric major histocompatibility complex (MHC) ligands.

We were able to identify a panel of HLA-A,0201-restricted peptides derived from the same region of the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) of LASV (GPC spanning residues 441 to 449 [ GPC(441-449) ]), LCMV (GPC(447-455)), JUNV (GPC(429-437)), MACV (GPC(444-452)), GTOV (GPC(427-435)), and WWAV (GPC(428-436)) that displayed high-affinity binding to HLA-A,0201 and were recognized by CD8(+) T cells in a cross-reactive manner following LCMV infection or peptide immunization of HLA-A,0201 transgenic mice.

One peptide, GPC-3522-530 FLAELAYDL, fulfilled our criteria as a naturally processed, HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope: i) it showed high affinity binding to HLA-A2, in T2 cell binding assay.

To precisely assess the relationship between TCR-peptide-MHC binding parameters and T cell function, we tested a panel of sequence-optimized HLA-A(,) 201/NY-ESO-1(157-165)-specific TCR variants with affinities lying within physiological boundaries to preserve antigenic specificity and avoid cross-reactivity, as well as two outliers (i.

Three peptides with HLA-A2-binding activity could bind the HLA-A,2601 molecule.

These findings demonstrate the need to evaluate MHC binding and T cell recognition of Cys-containing peptides under conditions that prevent Cys oxidation, and to adjust current prediction binding algorithms for HLA-A,02:01 and potentially additional class I alleles to more accurately rank peptides containing Cys anchor residues.

While the HLA-A,02:01 binding BRAF wildtype peptide KIGDFGLATV was traced in peptides isolated from all five cell lines expressing this HLA subtype, KIGDFGLATEK was not detected in the HLA class I peptidomes of two distinct BRAF V600E transduced cell lines with confirmed expression of HLA-A,03:01 or HLA-A,11:01.

Based on the HLA phenotype of the patients, we used NetMHC software to predict the neoantigen epitopes with high binding affinity to their MHC-I molecules.

1/K(b) transgenic (Tg) mice, we found that the overall structure of the peptide FA9/HLA-A,0201 complex displayed a typical MHC class I fold with Val2 and Ala9 as primary anchor residues and Val3 and Leu7 as secondary anchor residues that allow peptide FA9 to bind tightly with an HLA-A,0201 molecule.

Using recombinant MHC-I molecules, we show that TAPBPR binds HLA-A,02:01 and several other MHC-I molecules that are either peptide-free or loaded with low-affinity peptides.

We screened HLA-A2-restricted T cell candidate peptides of ZnT8 with different methods including computer algorithms, MHC-peptide binding and dissociation assays in T2 cell line, identification in HLA-A2 transgenic (Tg) mice and in vivo CTL assays.

These Abs had the same specificity as HLA-A,0201/IMP(58-66)-specific cytotoxic T cells and bound neither to HLA-A,0201 nor the peptide alone.

These Abs were not cross-reactive to other self-MHC class I alleles displaying IMP(58-66), but bound to MHC class I complexes of an HLA nonidentical offspring.

Using peptide-MHC binding algorithms, potential HLA-A2.

Several analogs containing the auxiliary HLA-A,0201 anchor residues were able to stably bind to HLA-A,0201 and enhance CTL responses compared with the native sequence.

In this study, using the novel NTA-His tag-containing multimer technology, we quantified the TCR:pMHC dissociation rates (koff) of tumor-specific vaccine-induced CD8 T cell clones (n = 139) derived from seven melanoma patients vaccinated with IFA, CpG, and the native/EAA or analog/ELA Melan-A(MART-1) (26-35) peptide binding with low or high affinity to MHC, respectively.

Using this approach we identified 4 novel MHC-I restricted epitopes: 2 with the binding motif for HLA-A24 molecules and 2 with both HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 binding motifs.

Matrices were used to generate a large panel of HLA-C-specific peptide-binding data and update our pan-specific NetMHCpan predictor, whose predictive performance was considerably improved with respect to peptide binding to HLA-C.

In addition to altering recognition by HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, the HLA-B2705-KK10 L6M complex also exhibits substantially increased binding to the immunoglobulin-like transcript (ILT) receptor 4, an inhibitory MHC class I-specific receptor expressed on myelomonocytic cells.

Within the groove of the MHC molecule are 6 pockets, two of which mostly display a high degree of specificity for binding amino acids capable of making conserved and energetically favourable contacts with the MHC.

We generated these HLA-B27 tetramers using immunodominant viral peptides with high binding affinity to HLA-B27 and cartilage-derived peptides with lower affinity.

However, an aggrecan peptide-specific T cell line derived from an HLA-B27 transgenic BALB/c mouse bound significantly stronger to the HLA-B27.

Four of six HLA-B27+ Ct-ReA patients had specific synovial T cell binding to at least one HLA-B27/Chlamydia peptide tetramer.

The HLA-B27/Chlamydia peptide 195 tetramer bound to synovial T cells from three of six patients and HLA-B27/Chlamydia peptide 133 tetramer to synovial T cells from two patients.

The binding to HLA-B7 of 18 selected peptides was assessed by competitive binding assays and was found to correlate with the computer-assigned scores, confirming the predictive value of these algorithms in selection of HLA-B7-associated peptides.

We screened for the presence of HLA-B27-restricted CTL epitopes from CEA by studying the binding to HLA-B27 of 31 synthetic peptides predicted to bind to this molecule.

Two of 11 HLA-B35-predicted binding peptides were able to stabilize HLA-B35 in an in vitro binding assay.

Analysis of the three shorter peptides representing HLA-B8 motif-bearing sequences within the two positive peptides for their ability to bind to HLA-B8 in vitro, and to sensitize target cells for lysis by effectors stimulated with the 15-mers, identified two overlapping HLA-B8-restricted CTL epitopes.

The recently reported three-dimensional structure of HLA-B27 and the identification of self-peptides bound to this major histocompatibility complex class I antigen can be viewed as a landmark in the understanding of the pathogenic role of HLA-B27.

We have searched the proteome of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis for HLA-B27 binding peptides that are stimulatory for CD8(+) cells both in a model of HLA-B27 transgenic mice and in patients.

This was done by combining two biomathematical computer programs, the first of which predicts HLA-B27 peptide binding epitopes, and the second the probability of HLA-B27 peptide generation by the proteasome system.

Here we show that HLA-B,58:01 binds and presents KF11 peptide, but HIV-infected HLA-B,58:01(+) cells fail to process KF11.

Furthermore, crystal structures of these viral peptide-HLA complexes showed that the Ag-binding cleft of HLA-B,18:01 was more ideally suited to bind shorter peptides, whereas HLA-B,44:03 exhibited characteristics that favored the presentation of longer peptides.

Surprisingly, the SB47 TCR engaged HLA-B,35:08(LPEP) using a completely distinct binding mechanism, namely " bypassing" the bulged peptide and making extensive contacts with the extreme N-terminal end of HLA-B,35:08.

We show that unmodified abacavir binds non-covalently to HLA-B,57:01, lying across the bottom of the antigen-binding cleft and reaching into the F-pocket, where a carboxy-terminal tryptophan typically anchors peptides bound to HLA-B,57:01.

Abacavir binds with exquisite specificity to HLA-B,57:01, changing the shape and chemistry of the antigen-binding cleft, thereby altering the repertoire of endogenous peptides that can bind HLA-B,57:01.

The discovery of the association between spondyloarthritis (SpA) and HLA-B27 inevitably turned the spotlight on T-lymphocytes as the cells which recognize peptide antigens within the binding groove of the HLA-B27 molecule and then carry out effector functions.

The remarkable similarity of the peptide-binding motifs and repertoires for Mamu-B,08 and HLA-B,2705 suggests that the nature of the peptide bound by the MHC class I molecule may play an important role in control of immunodeficiency virus replication.

The major ligands presented by MHC class I molecules after natural antigen processing are peptides of eight to ten residues in length, and it is widely accepted that the binding preferences of MHC class I molecules play a dominant role in dictating this classic feature of antigen presentation.

Abacavir\s specificity to HLA-B,57:01 is attributed to its binding site within the peptide-binding cleft and subsequent influence of the repertoire of peptides that can bind HLA-B,57:01.

Recently, we have found that the HLA-B,2705 presents an EBV epitope (pEBNA3A-RPPIFIRRL), lacking the canonical B27 binding motif but known as immunodominant in the HLA-B7 context of presentation.

The predicted MHC binding affinities of the 7 G8 variant epitopes were similar to the 3 D7 epitopes, suggesting that the amino acid substitutions of the 7 G8 variants may have interfered with TCR recognition of the MHC:peptide complex or that the 7 G8 variant may have acted as an altered peptide ligand.

Using a state-of-the-art imputation method to analyse the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, Ombrello and colleagues narrowed down the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B51 and Behçet\s disease to a model of five amino acids of the HLA-B molecule involved in the binding of the antigen, the interactions with receptors on CD8 T cells and natural killer cells, and the signal peptide of HLA-B, suggesting a crucial role of the cellular cytotoxicity on this disease.

To this end, HLA binding assays performed using nine HLA-B,2705-restricted ligands endogenously processed and presented in virus-infected cells revealed a common minimal peptide motif for efficient binding to the HLA-B,27 family.

Whilst paternal Class I MHC appears important, there is an important role for paternal non-MHC minor antigens (small peptides) that bind to the antigen-presenting groove of Class I MHC.

The MHC-1 Ld molecule has limited peptide binding compared to conventional MHC molecules such as Kb or Db, which correlates with polymorphisms associated with " elite control" of HIV in humans.

Mass spectrometry analysis of MHC II-bound peptides suggested that the abundance of endogenously processed peptides bound to MHC II molecules was significantly associated with the relative immunodominance of these epitopes.

MHC class II molecules, on the other hand, have been challenging to combine with mass cytometry as they are more complex and bind with lower affinities to cognate T-cell receptors than MHC class I molecules.

We performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of viral peptide-MHC class I binding affinity across 145 HLA-A,-B, and-C genotypes for all SARS-CoV-2 peptides.

The various prediction algorithms are being used to capture the MHC peptide binding preference, allowing the rapid scan of entire pathogen proteomes for peptide likely to bind MHC, saving the cost, effort, and time.

These structural differences probably reflect the fundamentally different ways in which Ly49 and NKG2D receptors recognize their respective ligands: whereas the single MICA binding site of NKG2D is formed by the precise juxtaposition of two monomers, each Ly49 monomer contains an independent binding site for MHC-I.

211 At-anti MICA/B Ab binds to human osteosarcoma SaOS2 and U2OS cells that exhibit high levels of MICA/B expression and efficiently kills those cells in\240\vitro.

Transplantation of the MICB alpha2 domain confers UL16 binding capacity to MICA, and thus, diversification of the MICA alpha2 domain may have been driven by the selective pressure exerted by UL16.

Instead, we mapped the BD association to seven MHC class I (MHC-I) amino acid residues, including anchor residues that critically define the selection and binding of peptides to MHC-I molecules, residues known to influence MHC-I-killer immunoglobulin-like receptor interactions, and a residue located in the signal peptide of HLA-B.

These receptors include Ly49s, killer immunoglobulin-like receptors, leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors, and NKG2A/CD94, which bind MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules, and NKG2D, which binds MHC-I paralogs such as the stress-induced proteins MICA and ULBP.

In kidney transplant recipients, polyreactive anti-MICA sera bound preferentially to ECs from MICA A5.

In C2GnT-expressing bladder tumour cells, poly-N-acetyllactosamine was present on core2 O-glycans on MICA, and galectin-3 bound the NKG2D-binding site of MICA through this poly-N-acetyllactosamine.

Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs2596538GA in the MICA promoter and rs1051792AG in the coding region (MICA-129Val/Met), influence MICA expression or binding to NKG2D, with MICA-129Met molecules showing higher receptor affinity.

IE2 directly activated MICA promoter via its binding to an IE2-responsive element that we identified within the promoter and that is conserved among different alleles of MICA.

Through analysis with the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that HBV infection promotes the expression of transcription factors GATA-2 and GATA-3, which specifically suppressed MICA/B expression by directly binding to the promoter region of MICA/B.

HBc protein inhibits MICA/B expression via directly binding to the CpG island in the MICA/B promoter.

The ability of anti-MICA on phages to bind MICA after doxorubicin conjugation was evaluated by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Flow cytometry and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay demonstrated that most of the phages (82 %) could be conjugated with doxorubicin, and the Dox-carrying phage-displaying anti-MICA (Dox-phage) remained the binding activity against MICA.

Our study has shed new insight into MICB genetic variation at population level, suggesting that binding sites for transcription factors in MICB promoter could be interrupted by polymorphisms within this region, resulting in allele-specific regulation.

We found that MICB,008 which contains methionine and asparagine at the amino acid positions 98 and 113, respectively, in the alpha 2 domain showed decreased binding activities to UL16 when compared to MICB,003, 4, and MICB,00502 containing isoleucine and aspartic acid, respectively.

These CD8 T cell responses included HLA-A,0201-restricted CTL activity, CD8/IFN-gamma T cell responses, and HLA tetramer binding against defined immunodominant epitopes in gag, pol, env, and nef as well as potent CD8/IFN-gamma responses against undefined HLA-A,0201-restricted epitopes in all remaining Ags of the library.

Eight HER-2/neu peptides displaying HLA-A,0201 anchoring motifs were selected and tested for their binding affinity to HLA-A,0201 and their capacity to elicit cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in both HLA-A,0201 transgenic mice and in HLA-A,0201(+) healthy donors.

By a cell surface MHC class I stabilization assay, four peptides were scored as good binders, whereas two peptides bound weakly to HLA-A2.

We propose that the accumulation of several assembly intermediates of HLA-C might favour the binding of peptide antigens not readily bound by HLA-A and-B molecules in neoplastic cells with suboptimal class I expression.

The crystal structure of the two immunoglobulin variable-like domains of the murine CD8alphaalpha homodimer complexed to the class I MHC H-2Kb molecule at 2.8 A resolution shows that CD8alphaalpha binds to the protruding MHC alpha3 domain loop in an antibody-like manner.

A peptide with Ala substituted at position 8 (8 A) showed higher HLA-A2 binding affinity and CTL recognition and was a more potent in vivo immunogen in HLA-A2-transgenic mice, inducing higher CTL responses with higher avidity against native C7A2 than induced by C7A2 itself.

We report the crystal structure of a complex between the murine N15 TCR [ 1-4 ] and its peptide-MHC ligand, an octapeptide fragment representing amino acids 52-59 of the vesicular stomatitis virus nuclear capsid protein (VSV8) bound to the murine H-2Kb class I MHC molecule.

The MHC class-I binding affinity of an epitope is an important parameter determining the immunogenicity of the peptide-MHC complex.

Cells expressing HLA-A2,-A24(9) and-A68(28) proteins were brightly stained with RG1 whereas mAb binding to HLA-A1,-A11 and a split of A3 molecules was significantly lower.

In the first approach, the immunogenicity of potential epitopes ranging in MHC binding affinity over a 10, 0-fold range was analyzed in HLA-A,0201 transgenic mice.

Second, this W6/32 mAb does not react with an HLA-A3 H chain/h beta 2-m surface complex formed by the exchange of H chain bound mouse beta 2-m for exogenously added h beta 2-m on lymphocytes from A3 single transgenic mice in which the HLA-A3 H chain is synthesized and transported to the cell surface in association with mouse beta 2-m.

HLA-A mutant DNA probe, in which the PP is disrupted, shows the same nuclear protein binding pattern as that of the HLA-C gene, and HLA-C mutant DNA probe, in which the PP is introduced, shows the same nuclear protein binding pattern as that of the wild type HLA-A gene.

These data suggest that the perfect palindrome and its cognate DNA binding nuclear protein play an important role in the HLA class I gene regulation, and thus the lower expression of HLA-C antigen may be ascribed to no or very weak factor binding to the nonpalindromic sequences of HLA-C upstream DNA.

Therefore, potent, noncytotoxic inhibition of cell proliferation, DNA and RNA synthesis via MHC molecules can be mediated specifically through effects initiated by binding to HLA-A molecules alone.

Four Lengsin-derived peptides were selected by computerized algorithm based on a permissive HLA-A,0201 binding motif, and were used to immunize HLA-A,0201 transgenic (HHD) mice.

Furthermore, mAbs targeting MHC class I, independent of the peptide bound by HLA, did not stimulate apoptosis, suggesting that the Ab-binding site on the MHC/peptide complex determines cytotoxicity.

0 has been trained on the hitherto largest set of quantitative MHC binding data available, covering HLA-A and HLA-B, as well as chimpanzee, rhesus macaque, gorilla, and mouse MHC class I molecules.

We have, therefore, developed a web server, MHC motif viewer, that allows the display of the likely binding motif for all human class I proteins of the loci HLA A, B, C, and E and for MHC class I molecules from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta), and mouse (Mus musculus).

An HLA-A,0201 restricted CTL epitope was deduced in silica from the amino acid sequence of the Bcl2 protein and its binding affinity for HLA-A,0201 was confirmed using a biochemical binding assay.

We combined steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation, single-molecule biophysical approaches, and functional assays to collectively demonstrate that mechanical force induces conformational changes in pMHCs to enhance pre-existing contacts and activates new interactions at the TCR-pMHC binding interface to resist bond dissociation under force, resulting in TCR-pMHC catch bonds\240\and T\240\cell activation.

Peptide binding analyses on HLA-A,02:01 and DLA-88,50101 via flow cytometry showed weak binding of DLA-88,50101 derived peptides to HLA-A,02:01, and vice versa.

Online biological softwares involved C-proteasomal cleavage, MHC class I binding affinity and TAP transport efficiency were used for prediction of HLA-A,0201 restricted epitopes from Eps8.

In thus study, we show that the MHC binding and consequent T cell reactivity against several HLA-A,02 restricted epitopes can be further improved through the incorporation of nonproteogenic amino acids at primary and secondary anchor positions.

To understand how an antibody can display high affinity and specificity for a particular MHC:peptide complex, we have employed X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of a recombinant antibody, Hyb3 bound to human HLA-A1 molecules presenting the peptide EADPTGHSY that is derived from the tumour-associated antigen MAGE-Al.

MHC-peptide-specific Fab antibodies binding to HLA-A,0201 complexes presenting the wild-type EAAGIGILTV (EAA) or analogue Melan-A 10-mer ELAGIGILTV (ELA) peptide were generated to study efficacy of peptide processing and presentation.

For Class II MHC alleles, the binding groove is open at both ends, causing ambiguity in the positional alignment between the groove and peptide, as well as creating uncertainty as to what parts of the peptide interact with the MHC.

We experimented on the HLA-A family with the binding nonamers of A1 supertype (HLA-A,0101, A,2601, A,2902, A,3002), A2 supertype (A,0201, A,0202, A,0203, A,0206, A,6802), A3 supertype (A,0301, A,1101, A,3101, A,3301, A,6801) and A24 supertype (A,2301 and A,2402), whose data were collected from six publicly available peptide databases and two private sources.

Typically, candidate selection relies on the prediction of MHC-peptide binding only, as this is known to be the most selective step in the MHC class I antigen processing pathway.

MHC binding is the last step in the antigen processing pathway and was predicted using a support vector machine method, SVMHC.

Compared to prediction of MHC binding only, we report an increased overall accuracy and a lower rate of false positive predictions for the HLA-A,0201, HLA-B,2705, HLA-A,01, and HLA-A,03 alleles using WAPP.

We have used MHC peptide binding algorithms to predict potential STEAP sequences capable of stimulating in vitro naïve HLA-A2-restricted CTLs.

CYP246 is characterized by strong initial HLA-A,0201 binding but a short MHC/peptide binding half-life.

In this paper, the empirical three-dimensional quantitative structure-affinity relationship (3 D-QSAR) methods were used to study the relationship between the three dimensional structural parameters (the isotropic surface area, ISA, and the electronic charge index, ECI) of the HLA-A,0201 binding peptide and the HLA-A,0201/peptide binding affinities.

To distinguish between MHC alleles that are exclusively dependent on TAP and those exhibiting only a partial dependence on TAP, two sets of MHC binding peptides were examined: HLA-A,0201 was selected as a representative of partially TAP-dependent HLA alleles, and HLA-A,0301 represented fully TAP-dependent HLA alleles.

We conclude that water molecules at the interface play the role of active mediators in the MHC-peptide interaction, and might be responsible for the large binding affinity of the MHC complex to a large number of epitope sequences.

In this role, it stabilizes the peptide-free conformation of class I MHC molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum and thus increases the number and variety of peptides bound to class I MHC.

Thermodynamic and kinetic analyses of peptide-MHC interactions as performed here may be of practical use in the engineering of peptides with desired binding properties and will aid in the interpretation of the effects of MHC and peptide substitutions on peptide binding and T cell reactivity.

Analysis of the thermodynamics of the interactions between the D3 T-cell receptor (TCR) and its natural ligand, an HIV peptide bound to a HLA-A0201 (HLA-A2) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) protein, shows both similarities and striking differences when compared with the 2 B4 TCR binding to its peptide-MHC ligand.

We demonstrate here that binding of HLA-A2 tetramers to CD8(+) T cells specific for the melanoma-associated antigen Melan-A/MART-1 can be fine-tuned by altering either the bound peptide epitope or residues in the alpha 3 domain of HLA-A2, which is important for CD8 binding.

In contrast, low CD8-expressing, antigen-specific T cells could be detected efficiently only by using a mutated HLA-A2 tetramer with an altered CD8 binding site or, less efficiently, using the wild-type HLA-A2 tetramer loaded with the peptide analogue ELAGIGILTV, which is superior in stimulating antigen-specific T-cell responses.

MHC binding of these peptides was determined in an HLA-A11 stabilization assay, and binding peptides were tested for CTL recognition in eight HLA-A11-positive FSWs.

Consistent with this model, we detected clusters of wild-type HLA-A2 molecules and of mutant A2-T134K molecules that cannot bind TAP, but HLA-A2 did not detectably cluster with A2-T134K at steady state.

The lumenal domain of US2 can differentiate between the products of distinct class I loci, as US2 binds several HLA-A locus products while being unable to bind recombinant HLA-B7, HLA-B27, HLA-Cw4, or HLA-E.

From the HLA-A,0201 binding peptides, we selected five E6-derived and one E7-derived peptide with high affinities for HLA-A,0201.

One of the selected phage antibodies shows binding to HLA-A1 complexed with the MAGE-A1 peptide, but does not show binding to HLA-A1 complexed with a peptide encoded by gene MAGE-A3 and differing from the MAGE-A1 peptide by only three residues.

Conversely, for complexes of HLA-A2 with the more hydrophobic peptides, the water molecules are more rigidly bound at the MHC-peptide interface and a number of well-defined water-binding sites exist.

less than 20 % of HLA-A2 expressed in the cells can be co-precipitated with either TAP, calreticulin or tapasin, the mutant proteins are expressed on the cell surface in a stable conformation, and bind a complex set of peptides almost identical to that of wild-type HLA-A2.

By using a MHC-binding assay, eight peptides derived from MAGE-2 were found to bind with sufficient affinity to the HLA-A24 molecule.

Cell lines derived from Ewing\s tumors largely lack polymorphic HLA class Ia antigens of both the HLA-A and the HLA-B loci but binding of monomorphic HLA antibodies indicates significant expression of HLA-C locus antigens and/or HLA class Ib molecules.

The finding that high and low HLA-B melanoma cell lines contain different transcription factors binding to elements not actively involved in the process of HLA-B locus abrogation suggests that these cell lines originate from distinct types of melanocyte precursor cells expressing a different set of transcription factors.

Additional MHC binding studies with the most common HLA molecules belonging to the HLA-A3 superfamily (HLA-A,1101,-A,3101,-A,3301, and-A,6801), demonstrated that CEA[9(61) ] binds five of five A3 supertype molecules with high affinity, and the HER2[9(754) ] epitope was able to bind to four of the same five alleles.

The binding of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule to a peptide originating in an antigen is essential to recognizing antigens in immune systems, and it has proved to be important to use computers to predict the peptides that will bind to an MHC molecule.

Second, we generate peptides that have high probabilities to bind to a certain MHC molecule, based on our proposed method using peptides binding to MHC molecules as a set of training data.

Furthermore, using an HMM trained for HLA-A2, we present new peptide sequences that are provided with high binding probabilities by the HMM and that are thus expected to bind to HLA-A2 proteins.

Here we determined the structures of the class I MHC molecule HLA-A,0201 bound to the native 126-134 epitope of the WT1 peptide and a recently described variant (R1Y) with improved MHC binding.

Stability measurements revealed how the R1Y substitution enhances MHC binding affinity, and together with the structures suggest a strategy for engineering WT1 variants with improved MHC binding that retain the structural features of the native peptide/MHC complex.

Experimental screening of large sets of peptides with respect to their MHC binding capabilities is still very demanding due to the large number of possible peptide sequences and the extensive polymorphism of the MHC proteins.

Dynamics of peptides within MHC binding grooves can influence TCR recognition, yet NMR studies which could address this rigorously have been hindered by the expense of isotopically labeled peptides and the large size of peptide-MHC complexes.

Using fluorescent peptide specifically fitting the groove of HLA-A,02:01, instead of antibody staining, also showed higher peptide binding on desialylated cells, confirming higher surface expression of MHC-I complex.

Attributed to the ever-expanding amount of MHC-peptides binding data, it enables the tremendous influx of deep learning techniques for modeling MHC-peptides binding.

Here, using a small-scale immunoisolation of the antigen serotypes HLA-A,02:01 and HLA-B,27:05 expressed on the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell line Jesthom and MS of the eluted peptides from both cells and EVs, we identified 516 peptides that bind either HLA-A,02:01 or HLA-B,27:05.

Here, we show that HLA-A,02:01-restricted EBV antigenic peptides EBNA1562-570, LMP1125-133 and LMP2A426-434 display binding degeneracy towards HLA-A,02 allelic microvariants, and that these pMHC complexes are recognised by anti-EBV TCR-like mAbs E1, L1 and L2 raised in the context of HLA-A,02:01.

Lastly, molecular docking and MHC-peptide complex stabilization assay were utilized to determine the binding energy and affinity of epitopes to the HLA-A0201 molecule.

The data demonstrate that a suboptimal anchor residue at position 2 enables the TCR to " pull" the peptide away from the MHC binding groove, facilitating extra contacts with both the peptide and MHC surface.

Some studies suggest that the germ line elements of the TCR engage the MHC prior to peptide scanning, but this order of binding is difficult to reconcile with some TCR-pMHC structures.

Recognition of MHC + peptide complexes by TCRs is thought to involve a large surface formed by exposed residues from the bound peptide and from the alpha-helices of the MHC protein.

The uneven distribution of mutations affecting HLA-B27 allorecognition by CTL 64.8 P strongly suggests an asymmetrical topology in the interaction of this TCR with HLA-B27, in which most of the binding energy is provided by contacts with HLA-B27 and/or peptide residues located close to pockets A and B, with little contribution from other areas of the MHC or peptide molecules.

X-ray crystallographic and peptide-MHC binding studies have begun to clarify the interaction between antigenic peptides and MHC proteins at the molecular level.

HLA-B27 homodimer expression on the cell surface of 721.22 is dependent on the unpaired cysteine(67) and is inhibited by restoration of tapasin function or by incubation with peptides that bind strongly to HLA-B27 heterodimers.

Indeed, the peptide binding motif and sequence of individual ligands eluted from Gogo-B,0101 demonstrate that, like HLA-B27, this gorilla MHC class I molecule binds peptides with arginine at the second amino acid position of peptides bound by the MHC class I molecule.

Therefore, although most gorillas that develop SpAs express an MHC class I molecule with striking differences to HLA-B27, this molecule binds peptides similar to those bound by HLA-B27.

Accordingly, naturally processed peptides derived from HLA-B,44 and HLA-B,27 specifically bind Mamu-A,11 and Mamu-B,03, respectively, indicating that conserved MHC class I binding capabilities exist between rhesus macaques and humans.

Crystal structures of antigenic peptides bound to class I MHC proteins suggest that chemical modifications of the central part of the bound peptide should not alter binding affinity to the MHC restriction protein but could perturb the T-cell response to the parent epitope.

Monofunctional spacers (11-amino undecanoate, (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate trimer) simply link two anchoring peptide positions (P3 and P9) but loosely contact the MHC binding groove, and thus decrease more or less the affinity of the altered epitopes to HLA-B,2705.

The N and C termini of peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are held within the peptide binding groove by a network of hydrogen bonds to conserved MHC residues.

We show here that while tapasin is required for HLA-A,0201 (HLA-A2) molecules to bind to TAP, its absence does not block the presentation of HLA-A2-restricted TAP-dependent epitopes to cytotoxic T lymphocytes indicating that, unlike HLA-A1, HLA-B8 and HLA-B4402, HLA-A2 has access to the TAP-dependent peptide pool even in the absence of tapasin.

The algorithm performs successfully in predicting peptide binding to MHC molecules with hydrophobic binding pockets but not when MHC molecules with hydrophilic, charged pockets are considered.

CTL clone KID-9 cross-reacted with allogeneic HLA-B7 and HLA-B27 molecules and recognized a distinct peptide bound to each MHC molecule.

T cells recognize MHC-bound peptide, suggesting that the TCR contacts surface MHC residues adjacent to bound peptide, but the extent of MHC contact is not known.

In the present report, we demonstrate that antibody L31, previously shown to react with beta 2 m-less (free) class I MHC heavy chains binds to an epitope (residues 66-68 of the alpha 1 domain alpha helix) present on all the HLA-C alleles corresponding to the accepted (CW1 through CW8) serologic specificities, and on a few HLA-B heavy chains sharing with HLA-C an aromatic residue at position 67.

Thus, free HLA-C and other Y/F67+ heavy chains are characterized by distinctive antibody binding features in a region (residues 66-68) included in a previously identified HLA-C restricted motif, which has been suggested to be the primary cause of distinctive features of the antigen-binding groove, low affinity for endogenous peptide antigens and beta 2 m, and preferential uptake of exogenous peptides, possibly of viral origin.

In vitro assembly assays employing synthetic peptides and recombinant HLA-B44 produced by Escherichia coli revealed that an acidic amino acid at P2 was necessary for promoting stable peptide binding to HLA-B44.

These results are in agreement with the experimental values of a semi-quantitative in vitro assembly assay, performed on the five nonapeptides (P3 = Gly, Leu, homophenylalanine, beta-naphthylalanine, alpha-naphthylalanine), which shows their ability to stabilize the native conformation of the HLA-B,2705 heavy chain and also shows that the three non-natural ligands bind with higher affinity (0.5 micro M) to the MHC protein than the two natural homologues (40 micro M).

Thus, this study demonstrates that structural information combined with rational design and molecular-dynamics simulations can illustrate and predict MHC binding and potential T-cell epitope properties as well as contribute to the design of new non-peptidic MHC inhibitors that may be useful for the selective immunotherapy of autoimmune diseases to which HLA alleles are directly associated.

This protein binds specifically to the HLA-A2 ISRE sequence, and binding is not efficiently competed by the ISRE sequences of the HLA-B7 or ISG54 genes.

The peptide transporter-deficient T2 line, which expresses a low level of HLA-A2 and its HLA-B7 transfectant subline, were used for this purpose because specifically bound peptides elevate the surface expression of these MHC molecules.

Peptides which possess the known primary anchor residue motif for HLA-B27 binding do not necessarily bind to HLA-B27 proteins.

In order to determine how T cell-presented peptides associate with the antigen binding sites (desetopes) of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and how they might be scavenged from an endogenous processing pathway for transfer to those molecules, we characterized the binding of two synthetic peptides restricted by HLA-B37 or HLA-A2 to class I MHC molecules and to cellular proteins of histotyped cell lines, by gel filtration and photo-affinity labeling techniques.

In gel filtration binding studies, each peptide associated with immunopurified class I MHC molecules from cells with its restricting, histotype, but little was bound to class I MHC molecules from cells without the restricting histotype and none was bound to bovine serum albumin.

After crosslinkage of a radioiodinated photoreactive derivative of influenza virus nucleoprotein peptide NP(336-355Y) and immunoprecipitations with antibodies to class I MHC molecules, that peptide was found to bind to immunopurified class I MHC molecules from HLA-B37+ but not HLA-B37- cells.

Antigen presentation at these sites occurs principally via transfer of intact, donor MHC-peptide complexes from graft cells to host DCs (cross-dressing) or by uptake and processing of donor antigens into allopeptides bound to self-MHC molecules (indirect presentation).

Epitopes centering the GSTA sequence are also predicted by NetMHC programs to bind to MHC molecules.

The past few decades have witnessed the accumulation of a huge knowledge base of the molecular structures of MHC molecules bound to numerous peptides, of TCRs with specificity for many different peptide/MHC (pMHC) complexes, of NK cell receptors (NKR), of MHC-like viral immunoevasins, and of pMHC/TCR and pMHC/NKR complexes.

Collectively, with a cost per peptide reduced to a few cents, combined with the flexibility of rHLA technology, this poses an attractive strategy to generate vast bodies of MHC-II binding data at an unprecedented speed and for the benefit of generating peptide-MHC-II binding data as well as improving MHC-II prediction tools.

In this model, mutations in MHC-like molecule(s) that bound new PAMP(s) would not be recognized by original TCR-like molecule(s), and new MHC-like gene(s) would be lost by neutral drift.

Most T cell epitope prediction tools are based on machine learning algorithms trained on MHC binding or naturally processed MHC ligand elution data.

A 1983 Immunology Today rostrum hypothesized that each T cell has two recognition units: a T cell receptor (TCR) complex, which binds antigen associated with a polymorphic region of a MHC molecule (pMHC), and a CD4 or CD8 molecule that binds to a conserved region of that same MHC gene product (class II or I, respectively).

Here, we review how MHC class-restricted binding impacts signaling and lineage commitment, discussing TCR force-driven conformational transitions that may optimally expose the co-receptor docking site on MHC.

Once MHC II molecules have bound a peptide, the MHC II-peptide complex is delivered to the cell surface for presentation to CD4(+) T cells.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I peptide binding and presentation are essential for antigen-specific activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and swine MHC class I molecules, also termed swine leukocyte antigens (SLA), thus play a crucial role in the process that leads to elimination of viruses such as swine influenza virus (SwIV).

According to the germline model, MHC restriction is intrinsic to TCR structure because TCR and MHC molecules have co-evolved to conserve germline-encoded TCR sequences with the ability to bind MHC, while eliminating TCR sequences lacking MHC reactivity.

According to the selection model, MHC restriction is not intrinsic to TCR structure, but is imposed by the CD4 and CD8 co-receptors that promote signaling by delivering the Src tyrosine kinase Lck to TCR-MHC complexes through co-receptor binding to MHC during positive selection.

HLA-A,2402 and HLA-A,3201 unequivocally protected target cells from lysis, whereas HLA-A,2501 and HLA-A,2301 provided only weak protection from lysis.

Although HLA-B,27 and B,57 are thought to target the most conserved parts of HIV, during disease progression, CTL responses restricted by HLA-B,27 and B,57 were lost at least as fast as CTL responses restricted by HLA-A,02.

Clonal analysis confirmed the restriction by HLA-A2 or-B5 of some cytotoxic T-cell clones and identified cytotoxic T-cell clones cytolytic for target cells which do not express HLA-A or-B but do express the HLA-C determinant.

Based on the capacity of different human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA)-C and HLA-B molecules to inhibit target cell lysis by NK lines and clones, three NK allospecificities have been defined: NK1 and NK2 cells are inhibited by different HLA-C allotypes and NK3 cells by some HLA-B allotypes.

This integrated strategy offers, for the first time, molecular-level understanding of MICA\s conformational dynamics in solution as well as the unique mechanism of actions of these antibodies in targeting MICA.

We show that coexpression of various pairs of cellular microRNAs interfered with the downregulation of MICB, whereas the viral microRNAs optimized their targeting ability to efficiently downregulate MICB.

This might be attributable to increased natural killing by allogeneic NK cells carrying a KIR that does not bind to HLA-C on target cells (HLA-C-uncoupled KIR).

Although numbers of KIR3DL1(+) NK cells were similar in HLA-Bw4(+) and HLA-Bw4(-) individuals, general levels of ADCC mediated against target cells were significantly higher in a group of HLA-Bw4(+) KIR3DL1(+) individuals than in a comparable HLA-Bw4(-) group.

We found that Capan-1 cells, originally reported to be HLA-A0201(+), actually only express HLA-A010101 and HLA-A300101 and were targets for HLA-A0201-restricted CTL only after transduction with an HLA-A0201-expressing lentivirus.

Expression of HLA-A,-B, and-C molecules on the SEB-coated targets also protected against cytolysis mediated by many NKB1-negative T cell clones, suggesting the presence of additional inhibitory MHC class I receptors.

Analysis of the recognition of HLA-A2 by using target cells transfected with mutated HLA-A2 encoding genes revealed that the nature of the amino acid at position 152 of the molecule is critical for recognition of the TCR-alpha beta+ as well as the TCR-gamma delta+ CTL clones since replacement of Val for Ala at that position resulted in abrogation of recognition of one TCR-gamma delta+ and one TCR-alpha beta+ clone and substitution of Val for Glu affected recognition of all clones.

Rotating stimulation of T cells with the three B7-expressing cell lines led to the generation of T-cell lines that were cytolytic for HLA-A2+ melanoma cells and other HLA-A2+ targets that were pulsed with HLA-A2-restricted MART-1 peptides.

Although most solid tumors express MICA and this molecule is a target during immune surveillance against tumors, it has been observed that high grade tumors from different histotypes express low amounts of cell surface MICA due to a metalloprotease-induced shedding.

CTL clones specific for the two peptides killed HLA-A,3101-expressing target cells infected with HIV-1 recombinant vaccinia virus, indicating that these peptides were naturally processed HLA-A,3101-restricted CTL epitopes.

Moreover, HLA-A2-restricted responses are largely absent in the acute phase of infection as the viral load is being reduced, suggesting that circulating viruses may lack immunodominant epitopes targeted through HLA-A2.

To better define the immunological mechanisms underlying HLA-B,27-mediated protection in HCV infection, we analyzed the functional avidity, functional profile, antiviral efficacy and naïve precursor frequency of CD8+ T cells targeting the immunodominant HLA-B,27-restricted HCV-specific epitope as well as its antigen processing and presentation.

A subset of clones specific for 5 T417-25 was cytolytic for MVA-5T4-infected HLA-A2 EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line target cells and for constitutively HLA-A2-expressing and 5 T4-expressing RCC tumor cell lines (including A498 RCC).

Moreover, residues targeted by HLA-B alleles in the HIV-1 proteome were significantly more conserved than the ones targeted by HLA-A alleles.

To explore the presence of cross-reactivity to HLA-C and the other non-classical HLA antigens expressed by trophoblasts, HLA-A and-B-restricted CD8+ T cells specific for Epstein-Barr virus, Cytomegalovirus, Varicella-Zoster virus, and Influenza virus were tested against target cells expressing HLA-C,-E, and-G molecules.

Because peptides presented by several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) supertypes are potential targets for immunotherapy, the aim of this study was to determine whether MHC molecules other than the A2 supertype present the TcTLE peptide.

To discern between these alternatives, P815 cells were co-transfected with HLA-B27, human ICAM-1, and LFA-3, and the transfectants were used as target cells with a series of HLA-B27-specific alloreactive CTL.

Our findings suggest that HLA-A alleles may be preferred targets because of the increased heterogeneity at HLA-B, although addition of a single HLA-B allele to a set of HLA-A alleles improved coverage.

Blocking experiments identified IFNγ-producing cells as CD8 T lymphocytes, with two peptides frequently recognized in HLA-B8+ patients and a third one targeted in HLA-B35+ subjects.

A subdominant HLA-B,14-restricted response targets Gag (DRYFKTLRA, HLA-B,14-DA9).

Moreover, E3-19K protein, which was found to inhibit both major histocompatibility complex I (MHCI) and MHC-I chain-related A and B proteins (MICA/MICB) expression on the cell surface, protecting infected cells from T-lymphocyte and natural killer (NK) cell attack, may be tailored to selectively target only MHCI or MICA/MICB, or to lose the ability to downregulate both.

We show that, in the kidney, MICA is predominantly expressed in tubule epithelial cells, the natural targets of BKPyV, questioning a role for MICA in the immune control of BKPyV infection.

Overexpression of major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related A (MICA) in cancer is useful as a targeted molecule for the delivery of doxorubicin to MICA-expressing cell lines.

In summary, MIF-derived peptide FLSELTQQL is HLA-A2-presented and recognized by RL21A on ovarian cancer cell lines and patient tumor tissues, and targeting of this HLA-A2/MIF complex with toxin-bound RL21A can induce ovarian cancer cell death.

The comparative weakness of most HLA class I associations with disease has made HLA-B27 an especially favored target for investigation, and more is known of the structure and peptide-presenting function of HLA-B27 than for any other HLA-B allotype (López de Castro 1994).

The HLA-B27-induced T-cell response was found to comprise two categories of clones: some recognizing HLA-B27 independent of H-2 molecules expressed by the target cells (unrestricted clones), others recognizing HLA-B27 in an H-2-restricted manner.

Reactivity against HLA-B7 was initially established because the clones lysed 2 target cells that shared only HLA-B7 with the immunizing cell line and they did not lyse five other cell lines that were HLA-B7 negative but expressed other class I or class II antigens found on the immunizing cell.

As before, lysis of single HLA-B7-negative target cells by two of the clones could be ascribed to recognition of HLA-B27 or HLA-B40.

Inhibition of major histocompatibility class II (MHC-II) on target cells or CD4 on CD4(dim) CD8(bright) T cells diminishes their anti-HIV responses, suggesting that CD4 on effector cells and MHC-II on target cells provides an additional arm of contact between effector and target cells which is critical to CD4(dim) CD8(bright) T-cell function.

CTL antiviral activity is dependent on recognition of antigenic peptides associated with MHC class I molecules on infected target cells, and CTL activation can be impaired by Nef-mediated down-regulation of MHC class I molecules.

CTLs can acquire MHC class I-peptide complexes from their target cells, whereas CD4(+) T cells obtain MHC class II-peptide complexes from APCs in a TCR-specific manner.

This downregulation does not always affect all MHC loci in the same way, as viruses target particular MHC molecules.

Memory CD8(+) T cells stimulated with AT-SCT presented on MHC class I/II-null cells show reduced cytokine production, slower kinetics of TCR downregulation, and decreased cell death compared with native nonamer MHC class I single-chain trimer (SCT)-activated T cells.

In particular, downregulation of MHC-I molecules at the cell surface can reduce the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize viral peptides presented by MHC-I molecules and thereby delay viral clearance by CD8+ T cells.

We hypothesize that these features restrict the peptides bound by HLA-C molecules and in this manner reduce the efficiency of HLA-C assembly and expression at the cell surface.

HLA-A24/survivin-2B80-88 tetramer analysis revealed that there existed an increased number of CTL precursors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HLA-A24(+) cancer patients, and in vitro stimulation of PBMCs from six breast cancer patients with survivin-2B80-88 peptide could lead to increases of the CTL precursor frequency.

Pre-treatment of an HLA-A0201(+) acute myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 with chidamide and/or decitabine increased sensitivity to purified CTLs that recognize PRAME(100-108) or PRAME(300-309) peptide presented by HLA-A0201.

Despite the fact that the cell surface expression level of HLA-C on both uninfected and HIV-infected cells is lower than those of HLA-A and-B increasing evidence suggests an important role for HLA-C and HLA-C-restricted CD8+ T cell responses in determining the efficiency of viral control in HIV-1-infected individuals.

The addition of peptides which can bind to the HLA-B,57∶01-abacavir complex and to HLA-B,58∶01 during the induction phase increased the proportion of HLA-B,58∶01 allo-reactive T cell clones from 5 % to 42 %.

It also led to an elevated expression of heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and transcription factor Sp1, and increased the binding of transcription factors Sp1 and heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) to the MICA/B promoter, resulting in increased expression of MICA and MICB.

These important variations in MICB expression among normal individuals could imply a significant difference in the natural immune response against infections or tumor transformation, and might thereby contribute to an increased aberrant immune response against self cells, providing the molecular basis for the associations of the MICB gene to different autoimmune diseases.

The haplotype analysis revealed that MICA,008-HLA-B,13-Cw,0602 and MICA,010-HLA-B,4601-Cw,01 were significantly increased in both Types I and II, whereas MICA,002-HLA-B,38-Cw,07 (1-3) and MICA,017-HLA-B,57-Cw,0602 were elevated only in Type I.

However, unlike MICA,002 in which the difference was a result of the absence of MICA,002 heterozygotes, the MICA,008 association may be caused by an increased frequency of MICA,008 homozygosity in patients (58 % vs.

Hypoxia decreased the expression of cell surface MICA only without increasing the secretion of soluble MICA, which is produced by proteolytic cleavage of cell surface MICA.

Hypoxia induced the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and knockdown of the expression of HIF-1α using small interfering RNA increased the expression of cell surface MICA and concomitantly increased the level of soluble MICA.

The present results indicate that hypoxia downregulates the expression of cell surface MICA without increasing the level of soluble MICA in a HIF-1α-dependent manner and suggest that the effects of hypoxia are not linked to the hypoxia-induced reduction of NO production.

Five HLA-B,57/58:01 progressors and 5 HLA-B,57/58:01 long-term nonprogressors (LTNPs) were followed longitudinally and we studied which compensatory mutations were involved in the restoration of the viral fitness of variants that escaped from HLA-B,57/58:01-restricted CTL pressure.

We previously reported that carbamazepine (CBZ)-SJS/TEN is strongly associated with the HLA-B,1502 in Han Chinese, which has been confirmed in other Southeast Asian countries where the allele is prevalent.

To understand the impact of these regulatory decisions, we researched the usage patterns for CBZ and levetiracetam, the trend of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis [ Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) ] reports associated with antiepileptic drugs and the take-up rates of HLA-B,15:02 tests in Singapore.

Serological typing of HLA-C could identify only a limited number of HLA-C antigens, resulting in a number of HLA-C blanks.

HLA matching of the donor and recipient was based on typing of HLA-A and-B antigens by serologic methods and by typing of HLA-DRB1 alleles by molecular methods, and donors were selected when disparity was limited to a single HLA-DRB1 allele or a single HLA-A or-B antigen.

Existing MHC class I expression systems are limited by the practical difficulty of probing cell populations with an MHC class I peptide library and the cross-reactivity of T cells that are able to recognise many variants of an index peptide.

The specific CTLs were stained with HLA-A0201 limited HBcAg18-27 epitope MHC-Pentamer and the frequencies of CTLs, T, B, NK and NKT cells were detected by flow cytometry (FCM).

Manipulation of the MHC-I presentation pathway, and thus limiting MHC-I cell surface expression, is used by many viruses to evade immune recognition.

" CMV downregulates the expression of HLA-A and HLA-B on the surface of infected cells to limit presentation of viral peptides to T-cells although HLA-C is relatively spared as it also engages with inhibitory killer immunoglobulin receptor receptors and therefore reduces lysis by natural killer cells.

The updated predictor was used to assess the specificities of HLA-C molecules, which were found to cover a more limited sequence space than HLA-A and-B molecules.

The CA5 and SB27 TCRs engaged HLA-B,35:08(LPEP) similarly, straddling the central region of the peptide but making limited contacts with HLA-B,35:08.

Viral escape within the immunodominant, HLA-B27-restricted, HCV-specific, cluster of differentiation (CD) 8 (+) T-cell epitope, nonstructural protein (NS) 5 B(2841-2849) (ARMILMTHF), has been shown to be limited by viral fitness costs as well as broad T-cell cross-recognition, suggesting a potential mechanism of protection by HLA-B27.

This would not rule out an intrinsic affinity of TCRs for MHC molecules achieved through multiple weak interactions, but for HLA-A2 the collective mutational data place limits on the role of any single MHC amino acid side-chain in driving TCR binding in a peptide-independent fashion.

Many efforts have been made to quantify the number of MHC-presented ligands by MS and to define the limits of detection of a specific MHC ligand.

While antigen processing and presentation (APP) by the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules have been extensively studied, a question arises as to whether the level of MHC-I expression is limited by the supply of peptide-receptive (empty) MHC molecules, or by the availability of peptide ligands for loading.

Taken together, these results indicate that a surplus supply of peptides is available inside the ER for loading onto the MHC-I peptide-receptive molecules, and that cell surface MHC-I expression is likely limited by the availability of empty MHC molecules.

Despite significant expression of HLA-B7 class I molecules on transgenic lymphoid cells, including thymic cells limiting dilution analysis and comparative study of TCR-alpha and-beta gene rearrangements of the eight isolated clones (which suggested that they all derived from the same CTL precursor) indicated that the frequency of HLA-Cw3-specific H-2 unrestricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes remained low (even in HLA-B7 x human beta 2-microglobulin double transgenic mice).

The level of resolution for HLA-B antigen assignment can be obtained by this combination of serology and limited DNA-based typing is equivalent to the HLA-B specificities defined by the WHO-HLA Committee.

Like other nonclassical MHC class I molecules, HLA-G exhibits limited diversity, but certain characteristics of HLA-G distinguish it from other nonclassical MHC class I molecules: it has a truncated cytoplasmic domain, it is the product of alternatively spliced mRNAs, and it is expressed primarily in the placenta.

In a second model, in which conditional expression of MHC II is limited only to B cells, showed similar overall cellularity characteristics compared with mice with complete MHC II deficiency.

Altogether, our data suggest that expressing an additional class II MHC can produce diverse effects, with more severe autoimmunity providing a compelling explanation for limiting the expression of MHC molecules.

In addition, HPV-positive cancer cells often down-regulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression ex vivo limiting the efficacy of MHC class I-restricted approaches.

Due to low pH and digestive enzymes, encapsulated protein cargo is largely degraded and processed in endosomes for MHC-II loading and presentation to CD4+ T cells, with very little antigen delivered into the cytosol limiting MHC-I antigenic loading and presentation to CD8+ T cells.

Expression of MHC-II is generally limited to professional APCs, but other cell types can express MHC-II under inflammatory conditions.

Despite high-coding capacity of CMVs and a broad CD8(+) T-cell response on the population level, which reflects polymorphism in major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) glycoproteins, the response in terms of quantity of CD8(+) T cells in any individual is directed against a limited set of CMV-encoded epitopes selected for presentation by the private repertoire of MHC-I molecules.

Targeting these MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells would facilitate the design of better Mtb vaccines with broader coverage across MHC haplotypes due to the limited polymorphism of MHC class Ib molecules.

Studies also suggest that drugs with a similar chemical structure to CBZ might also induce TEN/SJS in patients with HLA-B,1502.

These results demonstrate the role of the HLA-C locus in T-cell-mediated alloimmune responses and add to emerging evidence that indicates the need to evaluate HLA-C compatibility in selecting hematopoietic stem cell donors for patients who have an increased risk of rejection.

By contrast, the functions of the non-polymorphic MHC class I molecules (MHC class Ib molecules) have been elusive, but emerging evidence reveals that, in addition to antigen presentation, MHC class Ib molecules are involved in immunoregulation.

We describe the history of MHC I recognition by NK cells and discuss emerging roles for MHC II expression by ILC subsets, making comparisons between both mouse and human when possible.

The data demonstrate that the proximity of pMHC ligands, high association rate of CD8-MHC interactions, and relatively long lifetime of cognate TCR-pMHC complexes emerge as essential parameters, explaining the significance of MHC clustering.

In fact, most patients with AS are HLA-B27-negative, although there is emerging evidence that another class I HLA molecule, HLA-B 14 : 3, is associated with AS in black Africans.

The data thus indicate that HLA-C-restricted CTLs may have an under-appreciated antiviral role in the setting of Nef in vivo and suggest a benefit of promoting HLA-C-restricted CTLs for immunotherapy or vaccine development.

The results obtained for the AS pedigree and sporadic patients suggest that mutation of TREML2 is a major factor leading to AS for HLA-B27 (+) members in this large family and that TREML2 is also a susceptibility gene promoting the development of ankylosing spondylitis in HLA-B27 (+) individuals.

Our results demonstrated that targeted delivery of both HLA-B∗27-binding peptides into the ER can promote the HLA-B∗27 folding, decrease the levels of (B27-HC) 2, and suppress the activation of the IL-23/IL-17 axis in response to lipopolysaccharide.

Inhibitory receptor interactions with HLA-C promote NK cell ADCC licensing, but interactions between KIR3DL1 and its HLA-Bw4 ligand may be insufficient.

The HLA-B27 HC is thus an important target, and delivery of an HLA-B27-binding peptide to the ER capable of promoting HLA-B27 HC folding is a potential mechanism for AS therapy.

Here, we demonstrate that a His6-ubiquitin-tagged Tat-derived peptide (THU) can deliver an HLA-B27-binding peptide to the ER promoting HLA-B27 HC folding.

Sequential transfections of P815 murine mastocytoma cells with class I gene encoding either HLA-Cw3, HLA-A3, or HLA-B7 H chain and subsequently with a human beta 2-microglobulin gene were performed to evaluate the relative efficiency of human and murine beta 2-microglobulins in promoting the cell-surface expression of HLA-class I molecules.

Our study demonstrated for the first time that besides being involved in immune tolerance, HLA-C can directly promote placental growth without interacting with immune cells, which could provide a new insight into studying the functions of HLA-C at the maternal-fetal interface.

Similarly, induction of lca, which is predominantly expressed in primary and secondary lymphoid tissues, was marginal with the exception of a strong and transient upregulation in pancreas following SAV3 challenge Together, these findings suggest that certain Atlantic salmon MHC class I L lineage genes play important and divergent roles in early anti-microbial response and that their regulation, in response to different activation signals, represents a system for selectively promoting the expression of distinct non-classical MHC class I genes in response to different types of immune challenges.

MHCII-mediated interactions between B and T cells further promote B cell proliferation and differentiation, and, in fact, inefficient MHCII deletion on B cells led to strong selection of escaped cells in activated and plasmablast compartments, further underscoring the central role of B cell Ag presentation.

In terms of the association with high or low TNF-alpha, HLA-A, D, DR antigens were divided into 3 groups: 1) promoting antigens: HLA-A1.

Notably, LILRB1 cannot recognize the beta(2) m-free form of HLA-G or HLA-B27, but LILRB2 can recognize the beta(2) m-free form of HLA-B27.

Both allogeneic HLA-A,0201-matched and autologous CTLs recognized and killed endogenously OFA-iLR-expressing tumor cell lines and primary malignant cells from patients with hemopoietic malignancies in an MHC-restricted fashion but spared nonmalignant hemopoietic cells.

These data indicate that the previously anomalous position of HLA-A,2902 among HLA-A alleles, outside any recognized HLA-A supertype, is artifactual, and the true position of the A,2902 motif overlaps those of the A1 and A24 supertypes.

Cytotoxicity was mainly MHC class I/HLA-A,0201 restricted, suggesting that the CTLs recognized gp96-chaperoned peptides on HLA-A,0201 that were derived from shared myeloma antigens and that myeloma cells naturally present these peptides in the context of their surface MHC molecules.

These findings suggest that most HLA-A2-restricted TCRs recognize surfaces on the HLA-A2/peptide complex that are dependent upon the side chains of K66 and Q155 in the central portion of the peptide binding groove.

Such CTL also recognized tumor cell lines expressing both HLA-A2 and MAGE-3 in an MHC class I-restricted manner, but did not recognize tumor cell lines that did not express HLA-A2 or MAGE-3.

MHC-associated peptides isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography from HLA-A1 and HLA-A2 molecules of DM331 tumor cells included at least three peptide epitopes recognized by DM331 CTL and restricted by HLA-A1 or by HLA-A x 201.

The inhibitory NK receptors recognize mainly MHC class I proteins and in this regard practically all of the HLA-C proteins are recognized by inhibitory NK cell receptors, while only certain HLA-A and HLA-B proteins interact with these receptors.

Because rhesus macaque has counterparts of HLA-A and-B, but not HLA-C, we expected that rhesus KIR would better recognize HLA-A and-B, than HLA-C.

A crystal structure of a MART-1-specific γδ TCR, together with MHC/peptide, revealed distinctive but similar docking properties to those previously reported for αβ TCRs recognizing MART-1 on HLA-A,0201.

CTLs could be induced by using a human leukocyte antigen, (HLA)-A2 restricted antigenic peptide (BORIS C34_24(9)), from all of 3 HLA-A2-positive individuals, and CTL clone cells specific for BORIS C34_24(9) peptide could recognize BORIS sf6-positive, HLA-A2-positive lung carcinoma cells.

We investigated the role of a peptide bound to HLA-B molecules on the formation of the Bw4 epitope recognized by two HLA-Bw4-specific mAb, TU109 and TU48, which recognized the difference of the Bw4 epitope among HLA-B52,-B52 and-B53.

Such empty HLA-B27 molecules were not recognized by an HLA-B27-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clone (auto-1) derived from synovial fluid.

A set of mouse HLA-B27-reactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte clones were found to recognize the HLA-B27 molecule in an H-2-unrestricted manner, i.

We propose that MHC allo- and xenoreactive CTL responses are not caused by the activation of CTLp specific for self-MHC plus peptide but to the activation of CTLp recognizing MHC allo- and xenoantigens directly or as peptides presented by their native MHC molecules.

In addition, we could show that T lymphocytes of the transgenic animals respond to the same HLA-B27 restricted influenza peptide as is recognized by human influenza-specific, HLA-B27 restricted cytotoxic T cell lines.

HLA-B2705-restricted influenza virus-specific CTL also recognized HLA-B2703-positive virus-infected cells, and vice versa.

In contrast, engagement of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-recognizing killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs) on NK cells by resistant, MHC-bearing tumor targets blocks raft redistribution.

B51 showed cytotoxicity against a HLA-B,3501-transfectant cell line that did not express H-2 molecule, which indicates that these cytotoxic T cells recognize HLA-B35 molecules directly without H-2 restriction.

However, strong cell surface expression of a classical MHC class I molecule (most likely HLA-C) was exhibited by these EVT cell lines when grown on laminin, as indicated by W6/32 FACS analysis (Ab recognizing pan MHC class I), and Western immunoblotting with HC10 (Ab recognizing HLA-B/C).

KIR specificity for MHC class I can be broad, as in the case of a single p70 KIR that can recognize several HLA-B allotypes, including HLA-B,2705.

On the other hand, recognition of MHC class I can also be highly specific, as in the case of NK clones that recognize HLA-B,2705 in a peptide-specific manner.

To determine whether the broad and specific types of HLA-B recognition by NK cells reflect the use of different receptors or a property of a single KIR we analyzed the recognition of HLA-B,2705 by the p70 KIR-11, known to recognize several HLA-B allotypes.

We propose that NK cells, like alpha beta T cells and some anti-MHC Abs, directly or indirectly recognize MHC-bound peptides.

(a) Whereas recent studies have suggested that HLA-C antigens may be preferentially recognized by NK cells, our findings indicate that 70 % or more of all NK clones are able to recognize certain HLA-B alleles and many also recognize HLA-A alleles.

Because T-cell activation is initiated by the formation of antigen-MHC complexes that are the ligands that are recognized by the antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR), it might be possible to inhibit this activation by blocking the antigen-binding cleft of MHC molecules by using high-affinity MHC-binding peptides (MHC blockade) or by a novel, new, and more efficient method of TCR antagonism.

Conformational changes of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens have the potential to be recognized by T cells and may arise from polymorphic variation of the MHC molecule, the binding of modifying ligands, or both.

Since KIRs are expressed on decidual NK cells and the HLA-C molecules that they recognize are also expressed on invading trophoblast, KIR receptors may play a regulatory role in pregnancy by interacting with their trophoblastic HLA-C counterparts and providing trophoblast damage evading signals (KIR/HLA-C allorecognition system).

Here, we critically review new insights into: (i) the mechanisms controlling expression of HLA-C by EVT, (ii) the mechanisms by which decidual NK cells, effector T cells and regulatory T cells recognize HLA-C allo-antigens, and (iii) immune recognition of pathogen derived antigens in context of HLA-C.

Tumour recognition by CTLs depends on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, while NK cells recognize tumours expressing low or null levels of MHC class I molecules.

In the first of these sections, I offer a reinterpretation of MHC restriction that reframes the constraints on self-MHC recognition in terms of the probabilities of recognizing a given nominal antigen peptide in the context of an MHC molecule that is nonself on the basis of differing in amino acid sequence from the self-restriction element at one or more positions.

Unlike conventional αβ T cells, MAIT cells are not restricted by MHC molecules, but instead uniquely recognize microbially derived vitamin metabolites presented by the MHC-I like molecule MR1.

During development, if TCR-pMHC interactions exceed an affinity threshold, a signal is generated that positively selects the thymocyte to become a mature CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cell that can recognize foreign peptides within MHCII or MHCI, respectively.

Although LAG-3 has been reported to recognize major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, it did not recognize MHC class II universally.

Allogeneic MHC class I may be recognized by recipient T cells as an intact molecule (direct recognition) or may be processed and presented as an allogeneic peptide in the context of self-MHC (indirect recognition).

A murine model of chronic AMR was developed in which T cell deficient (Tcrbd-/-) C57BL/6 recipients were challenged with MHC-mismatched BALB/c heart allografts and T cell help provided by reconstituting with 103 " TCR75" CD4 T cells that recognize self-restricted allopeptide derived from the H-2Kd MHC class I alloantigen.

These data demonstrate that, in contrast to results in mice, TAP inhibition alone is insufficient for priming of MHC-E-restricted T cell responses in primates and suggest that additional unknown mechanisms govern the induction of CD8+ T cells recognizing MHC-E-bound antigen.

Because CD8+ T cells are MHC Class I restricted, they are able to recognize HLA-bound antigenic peptides presented not only by APC but also on parenchymal cells, thus eliciting or suppressing auto- or allo-immune reactions.

These MHC Ib-restricted CD8+ T cells recognized several Mtb-derived protein antigens at a higher frequency than MHC Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells.

No difference in affinity of this epitope peptide was found among these three HLA-A(,) 26 subtypes, indicating that Gag169-177 was effectively presented by HLA-A(,) 2602 but recognized as a subdominant epitope in HIV-1-infected HLA-A(,) 2602 (+) individuals.

In this study, we have identified five new HLA-B,57-restricted CTL epitopes recognized by SP donors, one of which is also HLA-B,5801 restricted.

In the majority of cases, CD4+ T cells recognize Ag in association with class II MHC molecules, while CD8+ T cells recognize Ag in association with class I MHC molecules.

In response to pressure exerted by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-mediated CD8(+) T cell control, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) escape mutations often arise in immunodominant epitopes recognized by MHC class I alleles.

Using a series of HLA-A2-restricted TCRs that recognize the same peptide-MHC class I complex (pMHC) with affinities varying up to 3500 fold, we observed that TCR affinity had no effect on the ability of the introduced TCRs to confer potent Ag-specific suppressive activity.

The most frequently represented HLA-A and-B alleles were HLA-A11, A02, and A33 expressed by 35.7, 23.2, and 21.4 % of the patients, respectively, and HLA-B75, B46, and B62 expressed by 35.7, 25, and 17.9 % of the patients, respectively.

HLA-A was expressed in 98 % and 96 % and HLA-B/C in 100 % and 94 % of colorectal cancers and liver metastases respectively.

In summary, IST efficacy in children with SAA that express the HLA-B,15:02, B,40:02, B,48:01, DRB1,09:01, C,01:02, C,03:04, DQB1,03:03 and DQB1,06:02 alleles may be superior, while the efficacy may be mitigated in children with SAA who express HLA-A,29:01, B,15:11, B,38:01, B,39:05, DRB1,15:01, C,01:02, C,08:22 alleles.

Instead, in individuals expressing HLA-B,27, the CTL response restricted by nonprotective HLA alleles was significantly higher and broader, and of higher affinity than in individuals expressing these alleles without HLA-B,27.

Comparison of HLA-A and HLA-B staining intensities within the villous stroma indicates that during first trimester of pregnancy the fetal HLA-B proteins are expressed before HLA-A appears.

Nevertheless, a more accurate functional analysis demonstrated not only that HSV infection downregulated the expression of HLA-A and HLA-B and did not modify the expression of HLA-C, but also that NK cell clones expressing the " activating" form of the anti HLA-C NK cell receptor were more cytolytic than other clones.

Human major histocompatibility complex class I antigens, HLA-C, are expressed on the cell surface at approximately a tenfold lower level than HLA-A and-B.

HLA-C molecules are poorly expressed at the cell surface compared with HLA-A and HLA-B locus products.

We show that the HLA-C4 allele is expressed intracellularly in amounts similar to HLA-A and HLA-B alleles.

HLA-C antigens are expressed to the cell surface at roughly 10 % the level of HLA-B or-A, and their serological definition remains persistently difficult.

We find that HLA-C mRNA is expressed at lower levels than HLA-B mRNA and that this difference results from faster degradation of the HLA-C message.

HLA-C gene products are the most poorly understood of the HLA class I molecules because they express at low level on the cell surface compared to HLA-A and-B.

In addition, HLA-C molecules are expressed at the cell surface at about 10 % of the levels of HLA-A and HLA-B.

Four lines (BL28, BL37, BL41 and Jijoye M13) showed down-regulation of both HLA-A and-C alleles, and one (BL36) failed to express one HLA-C allele.

Rates of successful search reach 85 % for patients (n=20) who express at least one common five-allele (HLA-A/B/Cw/DRB1/DQB1) haplotype, but also 77 % for more patients (n=53) who express at least one of the 20 most frequent three-allele (HLA-A/B/Cw) haplotypes.

Assuming that HLA-B is expressed on trophoblasts, we may suggest that the revealed predominance of HLA-Bw6 expression (which excludes the presence of HLA-Bw4-protective antigens) may predispose a particular couple to the RM phenomenon.

We observed a significant association between particular combinations of KIR epitopes expressed by HLA-B/-C haplotypes and propose that the repertoire of KIR epitopes expressed by HLA-B and HLA-C alleles within the context of particular haplotypes may be an important component of the NK mediated immune response to HIV and/or other infectious pathogens.

The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related gene A (MICA) is a highly polymorphic gene that encodes protein variants expressed under cellular stress conditions, and these MICA variants play important roles in immune activation and surveillance.

MICA,019 was highly expressed on the surface of fibroblasts whereas expression of MICA,007 was the lowest in the culture supernatant.

The induced CTLs exhibited specific lysis of T2 cells pulsed with the peptide and HLA-A2+ hepatocellular carcinoma cells expressing survivin, while HLA-A2+ hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines that did not express survivin were not recognized by the CTLs.

The peptidome of the BD-associated HLA-B,51:08 subtype expressed in a Hap10-positive cell line was isolated, characterized by mass spectrometry, and compared with the HLA-B,51:01 peptidome from cells expressing more active ERAP1 allotypes.

Flow cytometry was used to measure surface expression of HLA-B,27 in C1R/HeLa cells expressing HLA-B,27 (N97) and six mutants at P97 (N97T, N97S, N97V, N97R, N97W and N97D).

HLA-B,7, which has an AS-protective serine at P97 expressed lower levels of FHC than HLA-B,27 or HLA-B,51.

Loss of crossveins in the wings and a reduced eye phenotype were observed after expression of HLA-B,27:04 or HLA-B,27:05 in Drosophila but not in fruit flies expressing the non-associated HLA-B,07:02 allele.

HLA-C level varies between allotypes and cells expressing more HLA-C at baseline tended to have corresponding higher levels of HLA-C following cytokine stimulation (Pearson\s correlation coefficient between unstimulated and stimulated expression, P =.

MHC-II molecules, which are abundantly expressed on DC exosomes, were also functionally loaded under the same conditions as MHC-I.

Allogeneic DCs expressing HLA-A,0201, HLA-DR beta 1, 401, and HLA-DR beta 1, 701 were fused with 888 mel cells that do not express any of these MHC molecules, but do express multiple melanoma-associated Ags.

The remaining HLA-C and-E molecules prevent recognition by natural killer (NK) cells, which would otherwise lyse cells expressing small amounts of MHC-I.

Panc-1 cells were found to be HLA-A0201 positive, in agreement with published reports, while CF-Pac-1 cells were found to express both HLA-A020101 and HLA-A030101.

In short-term assays, m-CD95L-expressing APC-induced apoptosis in activated T cells and the constitutive presence of m-CD95L and HLA-A1 expressing APC in long-term T cell cultures prevented the expansion of CD4(+) and CD8(+) HLA-A1-specific T cells and the development of HLA-A1-specific cytotoxicity.

Interestingly, gp100, a melanoma antigen, can be presented by both MHC class I and class II when expressed endogenously, suggesting that it can reach endosomal/MHC class II compartments (MIIC).

Taken together, these CTL epitopes defined in HLA-A24 transgenic mice are also processed and expressed with HLA-A2402 in human cells.

To identify mAb reacting with the HLA class I alpha 3 domain, 14 mAb recognizing monomorphic determinants expressed on HLA-A, B, and C Ag or restricted to HLA-B Ag were screened in indirect immunofluorescence with mouse L cells expressing HLA-B7/H-2Kb chimeric Ag.

However, we observed selective recognition of the HLA-A2 expressing clones by autologous cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes (which contained CD8 cells) as well as allogeneic CD8+ TIL with a HLA-A2 restricted pattern of recognition.

To assess effectiveness of Gp120-Texo vaccine in transgenic (Tg) HLA-A2 mice mimicking the human situation, we constructed adenoviral vector AdV(Gp120) expressing HIV-1 GP120 by recombinant DNA technology, and generated Gp120-Texo vaccine by using Tg HLA-A2 mouse CD8(+) ConA-T cells with uptake of AdV(Gp120)-transfected HLA-A2 mouse bone marrow DC (DC(Gp120))-released EXO(Gp120).

Tested MHC-I alleles include HLA-ABC endogenously expressed and HLA-A2 exogenously expressed in Jurkat T cells.

A more efficient approach to induce HLA-A2 restricted CTLs, through immunization with a multi-epitope DNA vaccine expressing the HLA-A2 restricted HER-2 369-377, 435-443 and 689-697 epitopes, resulted in high numbers of peptide specific T cells but failed to induce tumor protection.

HLA-A,0201 transgenic, H-2D(b)/mouse beta2-microglobulin double-knockout mice (HHD) which express human HLA-A,0201 but no mouse class 1, was shown to provide a powerful model for studying induction of HLA-A,0201-restricted immune responses in vivo.

By crossing mouse strains that lack either murine MHC class I and class II genes and insulin genes, we developed YES mice that instead express human HLA-A,02:01, HLA-DQ8, and insulin genes as transgenes.

Among the most divergent clinical outcomes are the relatively good prognosis in HLA-B,5801 expressing persons and poor prognosis with HLA-B,5802.

Of the 320 patients undergoing HLA typing, HLA-A02 was the most common allele and only one individual (0.3 %) expressed HLA-B,5701.

In this study, we searched for novel HLA-B,0702 NS3 restricted epitopes following an optimized NS3NS4 immunization protocol in transgenic mice expressing HLA-B,0702 molecule.

The MHC class I molecule, HLA-B27 can be expressed as a number of non-conventional forms, in addition to conventional HLA-B27 heterodimers presenting peptide.

A hierarchy in susceptibility was found to correlate with HLA-C type in the unrelated panel: cells expressing HLA-Cw7 were found to be most resistant to lysis by this effector cell population.

Previous studies stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with the HLA-devoid K562 cell line revealed that NK cells from individuals with an iKIR encoded by the KIR3DL1 locus with self HLA-Bw4 as their ligands, had higher frequencies of tri-functional NK cells that expressed the degranulation marker CD107a and secreted Interferon-γ and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α than those from individuals who were homozygous for HLA-Bw6 alleles, which are not ligands for these iKIR.

Mallal (Perth, Australia) elegantly described a highly restricted HLA-B∗5701-specific T-cell response in abacavir-hypersensitive patients and healthy volunteers expressing HLA-B∗5701 but not closely related alleles.

Viral replication capacities varied significantly with respect to the specific HLA-B alleles expressed by the patient, and protective HLA-B alleles, most notably HLA-B81, were associated with lower replication capacities.

Although HLA-B,81:01 was expressed by both grandmother and grand-daughter, autologous virus in each subject encoded an escape mutation L188F within the immunodominant HLA-B,81:01-restricted Gag-specific epitope TL9 (TPQDLNTML, Gag 180-188).

We found the following results: higher frequency of patients expressing both KIR2DL3 and HLA-C1 among infected patients compared with exposed seronegative (odds ratio 4.8, P = 0.004), higher viral load in patients expressing HLA-C1 with KIR2DL3 compared with those without this receptor-ligand combination (median 4.8 vs.

Responses were examined in two models of altered MHC II ubiquitination: MHCIIKRKI/KI mice that express a mutant MHC II unable to be ubiquitinated or mice that lack membrane-associated RING-CH 8 (MARCH8), the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for MHC II ubiquitination specifically in thymic epithelial cells.

Furthermore, LAG-3, which reportedly binds to MHC-II, was highly expressed by tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cells in MHC-II-expressing tumors.

To study mechanisms of class I MHC antibody-mediated allograft injury, we tested the rejection of heart allografts transgenically expressing a single class I MHC disparity in wild-type C57BL/6 (H-2(b)) and B6.

MICA and ULBP2/3 were widely expressed by the analyzed lines, with a minority of them being also ULBP-1+, whereas MICB was undetectable.

The T3(b)-MICA Tg mice expressed MICA selectively in the intestine and had an increased number of TCRalphabeta CD4CD8alphaalpha, double-positive (DP) intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the small bowel.

Upon binding to MICA, NKG2D activates cytolytic responses of NK and γδ T cells against infected and tumor cells expressing MICA.

MAb E4 potently antagonized the cytolytic activity of NKL cells against BaF/3-MICA cells expressing NKG2D ligand, and blocked the NKG2D ligand-induced secretion of TNFalpha, IFNgamma and GM-CSF, as well as surface expression of CRTAM by NK cells cultured on immobilized MICA or ULBP-1 ligands.

Cell lines, established from MHC class I-negative and-positive melanoma metastases, predominantly expressed MICA and ULBP2 molecules on their surface.

We generated a highly immunogenic chimeric protein (BLS-MICA) consisting of human MICA fused to the lumazine synthase from Brucella spp (BLS) and used it to generate anti-MICA polyclonal Ab (pAb) and to investigate if these anti-MICA Ab can reinstate antitumor immunity in mice using two different mouse tumors engineered to express MICA.

MICA-129Met or MICA-129Val isoforms differing only in this amino acid were expressed in the MICA-negative melanoma cell line Malme, and clones with similar pmMICA expression intensity were selected.

The MICA-129Met clones also expressed more MICA messenger RNA (P = 0.0047).

In most previous studies, an MHC class I complex was formed in the refolding buffer with an expressed MHC heavy chain molecule and beta(2) m, respectively.

However, these CTL did not recognize a panel of HLA-A24(+) tumor cells that expressed MAGE-A3 at levels similar to those found in HLA-A1(+) tumor cells recognized by anti-MAGE-3.

In comparison with the native IL-13Ralpha2 epitope, the analogue peptides 9 V and 1 A9V displayed higher levels of binding affinity and stability in HLA-A2 complexes and yielded an improved stimulatory index for patient-derived, specific CTLs against the native epitope expressed by HLA-A2(+) glioma cells.

As an in vivo model for studying human MHC (HLA) class I-restricted CTL responses to viral infection, we established a series of HLA Tg mice expressing HLA-A2,-B7 or-B27 human/mouse hybrid genes on a background deficient for H2 class I (Tg HLA(hyb)/H2 class I DKO).

None of the four T cell populations specific for foreign HLA-A,0201 were stimulated by the aAPCs, whereas they did produce IFN-gamma upon stimulation with cells naturally expressing HLA-A,0201.

One of the CTLs that were induced using M2BP216-224 (RIDITLSSV) produced interferon-gamma in response to HLA-A2-positive T2 cells pulsed with the same peptide and lysed MDA-MB-231 cells expressing both M2BP and HLA-A2.

In the virus-specific CD8(+) T cell population, the proportion of IFN-gamma- and TNF-alpha-producing cells, restricted by individual HLA-A and-B alleles, was determined using virus-infected C1R cells expressing a single HLA-A or-B allele for restimulation of these cells.

We have developed HLA-A2402/K(b)-transgenic mice expressing chimeric human (alpha1 and alpha2 domains of HLA-A2402) and mouse (alpha3, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of H-2K(b)) class I molecules.

First, we analysed the prevalence of HLA-A2 allele in the study populations and found that approximately 38 of the individuals expressed this molecule and that 50 of them were HLA-A,0201.

The same HLA-C allotype specifically protected infected cells from attack by NK cells that expressed a corresponding HLA-C-specific KIR.

NLV-specific CD8+ T cells were expanded for 13 days from 14 HLA-A,02:01/CMV seropositive healthy donors and 11 lung transplant recipients (LTR) then assessed for the production of IFN-γ and CD107a expression in response to 19 cell lines expressing either single HLA-A or-B class I molecules.

Furthermore, increasing evidence of variations in the peptide-binding repertoire and CTL responses among HLA-A2 allelic variants suggests the need to understand these differences among various frequently expressed HLA-A2 molecules.

Expanded T cells specifically recognised peptide-pulsed target cells or antigen-transfected cells in the context of HLA-A 201 and killed HLA-A 201 (+) ET lines expressing the antigen while HLA-A 201 (-) ET lines were not affected.

Here we employ a heterologous cell/MHC I system which uses mouse cells expressing both E5 and HLA-A2, and A2-restricted CTLs.

As exemplified for viral epitopes restricted to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2, the HLA-A2+ human somatic cell hybrid T2 provided an about 10-fold more sensitive readout as compared to autologous B-lymphoblastoid cells or the human erythroleukemia cell line K562 transfected to express HLA-A2 when used as target cells.

In this study, beta-2-microglobulin (beta 2 m, beta(2) m) linked HLA-A24 single chain was expressed on RMA-S cell line defective in the endogenous antigen processing and applied for screening of peptides which could stabilize the HLA-A24 complex on the cell surface.

Most possible combinations of uterine NK KIR receptors and fetal HLA-C molecules expressed by the trophoblast are compatible with normal pregnancy, but the risk of severe preeclampsia appears to be far higher than normal when the mother\s uterine NK cells do not express activating KIR (AA genotype) and when her fetus possesses group C2 HLA-C molecules.

To explore this, we analyzed HLA-C,12:02-restricted HIV-1 peptides presented on HIV-1-infected cells expressing only HLA-C,12:02 (a protective allele) using liquid chromatography-tandem MS (LC-MS/MS).

This observation was consistent across a panel of class I-reduced (C1R) cell lines expressing 14 different HLA-A or-B alleles and a panel of 721.221 cell lines expressing 11 HLA-C alleles.

To establish an NOD mouse model for the study of HLA-B,39:06, we expressed it in the absence of murine class I MHC.

TCR-redirected CD8⁺ T cells lysed WT1-overexpressing human lung cancer cells in an HLA-A,2402-restricted manner, but did not kill normal cells positively expressing HLA-A,2402.

Surprisingly, only individuals expressing HLA-B,3508 show evidence of a CTL response to the (77) APQPAPENAY(86) epitope even though EBV-infected cells expressing HLA-B,3501 process and present similar amounts of peptide for CTL recognition, suggesting that factors other than peptide presentation levels are influencing immunogenicity.

HLA-B,0702 transgenic mice (expressing a chimeric heavy chain with a murine alpha 3 domain: HLA-B7(m alpha 3)) in which the H-2K(b) and H-2D(b) class I-a (Cl I-a(-/-)) genes have been inactivated were compared with H-2K(b) D(b) Cl I-a(+/+) positive controls.

The lysis pattern of the allogeneic cells appeared to be related to the NK2 specificity for both effector cells: LCL expressing HLA-Cw2, Cw4, Cw5, or Cw6 alleles were lysed, while LCL expressing HLA-Cw1, Cw3, or Cw7 molecules were resistant.

The serological polymorphism is poorly defined, HLA-C molecules are expressed at the cell surface at about 10 % the levels of HLA-A and-B, and their importance for antigen presentation to either CD8-bearing T cells or natural killer cells is unclear.

Interestingly, one patient did not express HLA-B,0702, but three clones from this patient recognised the MAGE-A1(289-298) peptide on a lymphoblastoid cell line (LCLs) expressing HLA-Cw7, and we now show evidence that the MAGE-A1(289-298) peptide is expressed and recognised through Cw7.

These new conditional ligands greatly add to the application of MHC-based technologies in the analyses of T-cell recognition as they represent frequently expressed HLA-B molecules.

HLA-A,0201 genes (wild type or mutated at residue 227) were transfected into a cell line that lacked expression of HLA-A or B molecules but expressed HLA-Cw4.

We hypothesized that the magnitude of the HLA-C-restricted immune pressure on HIV would be greater in subjects with highly expressed HLA-C alleles.

However, viral regulation of the MHC class II-mediated CD4+ T cell response is understudied in endogenous MHC class II-expressing cells, largely because the popular cell culture systems utilized for studying HCMV do not endogenously express MHC class II.

We investigated the impact of HCMV infection on MHC class II in Kasumi-3 cells, a myeloid-progenitor cell line that endogenously expresses the MHC class II gene, HLA-DR.

This is an important finding, as it highlights a mechanism of immune evasion utilized by HCMV to decrease the expression of MHC class II in a relevant cell system that endogenously expresses the MHC class II complex.

HA identified a morphologically distinct subpopulation of cells within the immature DC population (CD11c(+) MHC II(mid/low)) that were CCR5(+)/CCR7(-) and proliferated in response to GM-CSF, but, unlike immature DCs, did not develop into mature DCs expressing CCR7 and high levels of MHC II, even after stimulation with LPS.

The recombinant eukaryotic expression vector pEGFP-N1-MICA has been constructed successfully and stably expressed in Tca8113-Tb cell line, providing a foundation for further studies on the function of MICA in vitro.

It was found that MICA was expressed on ovarian and colonic tumour tissues and could be detected by these anti-MICA MoAbs.

The efficiency of this cytolytic activity depended greatly on the level of MICA expressed on the cell surface and could be inhibited by anti-MICA MoAbs.

To determine the function of MICB in vivo and the relationship between the expression of MICB and BD experimentally, we produced several transgenic mouse lines (termed CAG-MICB) expressing human MICB cDNA under a ubiquitous promoter.

Conversely, silencing of this miR cluster enhanced MICA expression in cells that express substantial amounts of MICA.

In agreement, MICA/B were expressed in vivo in well-differentiated colorectal tumors with retained epithelial characteristics, whereas no expression of MICA/B was detected in poorly differentiated and invasive colorectal tumors that have lost epithelial characteristics.

In the present study, we examined induction of MICA/B on DCs by various innate cytokines and found that DCs from either healthy donors or HCV-infected individuals, upon IL-15 stimulation express MICA/B and can activate NK cells, which is solely dependent on MICA/B-NKG2D interaction.

MICA/B expressed on hepatoma cells contributed to their NK sensitivity, because Huh7 and HepG2 were less susceptible to NK cytolysis when MAb against MICA/B was added during the cytolysis assay.

NCRs specific for classical and non-classical MHC class I proteins expressed in complex patterns of inhibitory and activating isoforms on overlapping, but distinct, subsets of NK cells, play an important role in immunosurveillance against cells that have reduced MHC class I expression as a result of infection or transformation.

Using anti-MICA specific rabbit sera we previously demonstrated that freshly isolated monocytes, keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells express MICA.

Although this finding raises the question of how these patients became immunized, the fact that the polymorphic, HLA-like MICA molecule expressed at the cell surface of endothelial cells, is recognized by specific antibodies in sera of transplanted patients, suggests the MICA may be a target molecule in allograft rejection.

Unequivocal MICA typing was achieved for 85 of the 103 cells tested, 6 cells gave ambiguous MICA types, and a further 12 cells showed patterns consistent with them expressing at least one new MICA allele.

The finding that interactions with MHC molecules downregulate the function of these CD4(+) T cells suggests that these non-MHC-restricted T cells may function to detect and eliminate cells with aberrant MHC expression.

Using BCR/ABL peptide/MHC tetramers, significantly higher frequencies of tetramer positive cells were detected in the peripheral blood of HLA-A,0301 (mean 0.38 %) and HLA-B,0801 (mean 0.28 %) CML patients than in healthy donors (P = 0.0025 and 0.0026, respectively).

After a long period dominated by the question what the sex chromosome constitution of this species might be and where the testis determining factor could be located, the presence of Sry had been eventually excluded and sex determination attributed to a hypothetical mutated gene acting downstream of Sry.

This finding, together with published data on TDF-related renal phosphate losses, this finding raises concerns that TDF use could result in osteomalacia with a loss in bone mineral density at least in a subset of patients.

We find that two sex-determining region genes, Sry and Zfy, are transcribed during mouse preimplantation development, while the Zfy homologs Zfx and Zfa and a sex-determining region gene originally called A1s9 (now called Ube1y-1) are not.

HIV-1 Nef has been reported to disrupt MHC class II (MHCII)-mediated Ag presentation by a dual strategy that comprises a reduction in cell surface levels of peptide-loaded mature MHCII molecules and a up-regulation of immature MHCII molecules.

Our data suggest that Nef uses mechanisms involved in normal MHCII recycling and turnover to mediate the delivery of cell surface MHCII to a lysosomal destination.

In six (33.3 %) tumor specimens, an HLA class I allotype was missing (HLA-A2,-A28,-A29,-B18,-B35, and-B55), in two cases a haplotypic loss (HLA-A2,-B44 and HLA-A2,-B13) and in another case an allotype-specific loss combined with a haplotypic loss (HLA-A26,-A32,-B41) were observed.

Missing HLA-B and/or HLA-C ligand combined with missing HLA-A3/11 (KIR3DL2 unblocked) predicted for reduced relapse incidence regardless of diagnosis or conditioning type (P = 0.028).

Instead of proposing an approach for selecting a proper non-quadratic function and determining the dominant ICs, the DEMICA method combines all possible base MICA models developed with different non-quadratic functions and different sets of dominant ICs into an ensemble, and a double-layer Bayesian inference is formulated as a decision fusion method to form a unique monitoring index for online fault detection.

In this first study in a population with low HLA-B27 prevalence, IgG4 anti-CD74 antibodies combined with HLA-B27 showed higher diagnostic value than HLA-B27 alone for early axSpA.

Additionally, the AUC for HLA-C alone (rs10484554) was equivalent to the AUC for all nine other risk loci combined (66.2 % versus 63.8 %, p = 0.18), highlighting the dominance of HLA-C as a risk locus.

This study suggested that HLA-Cw6, overweight and higher waist-hip ratio are material risk factors of psoriasis vulgaris, specially the combined effects of HLA-Cw6 and BMI, WHR on psoriasis vulgaris in Chinese population.

Moreover, LCE3A showed significantly higher expression in patients bearing homozygous risk genotype in presence of HLA-Cw6 allele but not in those having non-risk genotype, demonstrating the combined effect of HLA-Cw6 allele and risk associated genotype near LCE3A gene.

A hybrid mouse monoclonal IgGl having one low affinity combining site for HLA-A2 and one low affinity combining site for HLA-B7 was made by the chemical method of Nisonoff and Palmer (Science 143 : 376, 1964).

In the present study, we have derived polyclonal monospecific cell lines from circulating Melan-A-specific CTL precursors of HLA-A,0201+ melanoma patients by combining stimulation with recently identified peptide analogues of the immunodominant epitope from the melanoma-associated antigen Melan-A with staining with fluorescent HLA-A,0201/Melan-A peptide tetramers.

Conserved HLA-A locus-specific primers of intron 1 or 3 were combined in 10 primer-mixes with group-specific primers hybridizing to the 5 \-or 3 \-end of exon 3 or 2 for pre-typing of the HLA-A alleles in 14 allelic groups.

We used classical Sanger sequencing techniques to type the HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 genes in the available 1000 Genomes samples and combined the results with the 103, 310 variants in the MHC region genotyped by the 1000 Genomes Project.

Finally, we defined class I and class II transcripts that are associated with 100 extended MHC haplotypes in this breeding colony by combining our genotyping analyses with short tandem repeat (STR) patterns across the MHC region.

We recently generated the NetH2pan prediction tool for murine class I MHC ligands by building an FVB/NJ H-2q ligand database and combining it with public information from six other murine MHC alleles.

Immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 and MHC class I combined A, B, and C heavy chains (MHC class I) was assessed in 58 human papillomavirus-associated cervical and vulvar lesions, including 27 squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) and 31 invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

That is, women with combined PPARGC1A A/A and NRF1 A/A genotypes presented the highest proportion of MHC-I and the lowest proportion of MHC-IIx, in contrast to women with combined PPARGC1A GG+GA and NRF1 AG+GG genotypes, who presented the lowest proportion of MHC-I and the highest proportion of MHC-IIx.

Here, we developed an integrated predictor of MHC class I presentation that combines new models for MHC class I binding and antigen processing.

These data suggest that MHC II-restricted TCRs against NY-ESO-1 from a nontolerant nonhuman host are of optimal affinity and that the combined use of MHC I- and II-restricted TCRs against NY-ESO-1 can make adoptive T cell therapy more effective.

We noted that the ectopic expression of CDX1 enhanced COX-2 gene expression and that bile acid was associated with the induction of CDX1 expression.

CDX1 overexpression increased expression of the intestinal markers Villin, sucrose isomaltase (SI), and MUC2, induced spheroid formation, and enhanced expression of the stem cell markers CD44, SOX2, Oct4, and Nanog, while CDX1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and intestinal stemness.

pylori-induced CDX1 expression may enhance gastric cancer tumorigenesis and progression, and support therapeutic targeting of CDX1 in gastric cancer.

The resistance of CD44(+) CD24(+) Cdx1(+) cells to paclitaxel is associated with upregulation of Cdx1 and Bcl-2 expression, caspase-3 activity, and the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I.

Cdx1b can bind to the Cdx1-binding motif located in intron 1 of the foxa2 gene based on an electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

EMSA showed that both Cdx1 and Cdx2 could bind to the cis element, but in cotransfection experiments, Cdx2 inhibited the Cdx1 effects by approximately 50 %.

In the present study, we present evidence suggesting that chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor (COUP-TF) members antagonize RA-induced Cdx1 expression by competing with retinoid X receptor-retinoic acid receptor heterodimers for binding to the Cdx1 RA response element.

Demonstration of Cdx1 binding to the PAP I promoter region and suppression of PAP I induction after deletion of the corresponding sequence indicated that Cdx1 is a transcription factor controlling PAP I gene expression in intestinal cells.

Using gel shift mobility assay, mutagenesis and competition experiments, we show that both CDX1 and CDX2 can bind the minimal promoter, but only CDX1 can transactivate it.

In conclusion, transgenic Cdx2 induced endogenous Cdx1 through the binding of Cdx2 to the unmethylated Cdx1 promoter region in the intestinal metaplasia of the Cdx2-transgenic mouse stomach.

We analyzed DNA methylation and histones modifications associated with CDX2 and CDX1 promoters in two human colon cancer cell lines expressing differentially these genes, Caco2/TC7 [ CDX2 positive-CDX1 negative] and HT29 [ CDX2 negative-CDX1 negative] cells.

The CDX1 homeobox gene encodes a transcription factor specifically expressed in normal intestinal and colonic epithelia, and CDX1 gene expression is affected during colorectal tumour progression.

To clarify the differences in the roles of Cdx1 and Cdx2 in intestinal metaplasia, we generated transgenic mice expressing Cdx1 in the gastric mucosa and compared Cdx1 induced gastric mucosal morphological changes with Cdx2 induced intestinal metaplasia.

We used stable transfection of inducible constructs and transient expression with a replication-deficient adenovirus to induce Cdx1 expression in rat IEC6 cells, a non-transformed intestinal epithelial cell line that does not express Cdx1 protein.

In cells overexpressing both Cdx1 and Cdx2, tumorigenicity was decreased by 50 %, resistance to apoptosis was significantly lowered, and stimulated cell migration was further decreased to 15 % of control compared with cells expressing Cdx1 or Cdx2.

The five remaining cell lines had a partially methylated CDX1 promoter and all expressed CDX1 mRNA.

Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA) and bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that the CDX1 promoter is methylated in CDX1 non-expressing colorectal cancer cell lines but not in human normal colon tissue and T84 cells, which express CDX1.

Results showed that Cdx1 markedly induced IAP mRNA expression, whereas Cdx2 did not, and, in fact, inhibited the Cdx1 effects.

We have now found that Cdx1 and LEF1, a nuclear effector of Wnt signaling, synergize to induce expression from the Cdx1 promoter through previously documented LEF/T-cell factor response elements.

Cdx1 expression in IEC-6 cells induces phenotypic changes characteristic of differentiating enterocytes, suggesting an important role for Cdx1 in the transition from stem cells to proliferating/transit cells.

Overexpression of Cdx1 or Cdx2 in human colon cancer cell lines induced expression of endogenous SLC5A8, whereas CDX1 and CDX2 knockdowns reduced its level.

CDX1 overexpression increased expression of the intestinal markers Villin, sucrose isomaltase (SI), and MUC2 induced spheroid formation, and enhanced expression of the stem cell markers CD44, SOX2, Oct4, and Nanog, while CDX1 knockdown inhibited proliferation and intestinal stemness.

Results showed that Cdx1 markedly induced IAP mRNA expression, whereas Cdx2 did not, and, in fact inhibited the Cdx1 effects.

Cdx1 activates the IAP gene via a novel cis element, whereas Cdx2 inhibits the Cdx1 effects.

Intratumoral injection of Cdx1 siRNA significantly inhibited tumor growth in a xenograft tumor model inoculated with CD44(+) CD24(+) Cdx1(+) cancer cells.

Upon identifying regulatory sequences responsible for posterior Mafb repression, we have used in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses to determine that Cdx1 directly inhibits early Mafb expression in the neural tube posterior of the r6/r7 boundary, which is the anteriormost boundary of Cdx1 expression in the hindbrain.

We also find that Cdx1 expression is markedly attenuated in a stage- and tissue-specific fashion in the Wnt3a hypomorph vestigial tail, and present data demonstrating that Wnt3a and RA synergize strongly to activate Cdx1.

In this regard, we have previously shown that, in the mouse, Cdx1 is directly regulated by RA at the late primitive streak stage (embryonic day (E) 7.5) through a RA response element in the proximal Cdx1 promoter.

Previously, we found that Caudal-related homeobox gene1 (Cdx1) is directly regulated by the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, and we identified Wnt/beta-catenin responsive elements in the Cdx1 promoter.

These results suggest that CDX1 promoter hypermethylation is one of the molecular mechanisms that accounts for reduced CDX1 gene expression in colorectal carcinoma.

Lastly, Cdx1 expression did not alter cyclin D1 mRNA stability but did reduce cyclin D1 promoter activity, suggesting that Cdx1 acts to diminish cyclin D1 gene transcription.

However, forced expression of CDX1 in HCT116 leads to reduced clonogenicity and production of differentiating crypt-containing colonies, which can explain the selection for reduced CDX1 expression in many colorectal cancers.

Colon tumor-specific DNA methylation at Cdx1 is reduced in the DNA-hypomethylated tumors accompanied by Cdx1 derepression and an increased expression of intestinal differentiation-related genes.

We also find that Cdx1 expression is lost in Min mouse polyps with increased nuclear localization of beta-catenin, suggesting that Cdx1 does not support beta-catenin-mediated transformation.

Silencing of Cdx1 expression and treatment with lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A increased paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in CD44(+) CD24(+) Cdx1(+) cells.

This autoregulation is reflected by the ability of Cdx1 to affect expression from proximal Cdx1 promoter sequences in tissue culture.

We have previously shown that Cdx1 is a direct retinoid target gene, suggesting that Cdx1 may convey some of the effects of retinoid signaling.

CDX1/2 targets were, however, not enriched, suggesting that although CDX1/2 activation reportedly plays a role in BM development, it may not be an initial event.

IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that CDX1 contributes to the tumorigenesis and progression of gastric cancer and suggests the potential of targeting CDX1 to treat this malignancy.

Moreover, caudal-type homeobox 1 (CDX1) was identified as a direct target of miR-155 and miR-155/CDX1 rescued the effects of XIST in breast cancer cells.

A transcriptionally inactive Cdx1 mutant could not elicit this effect, suggesting that it required Cdx1 transcriptional activity.

We also report that the specific stimulatory effect of CDX1 on the Glc6Pase TATA-box, compared to CDX2 is related to the fact that CDX1, but not CDX2, can interact with the TATA-binding protein.

We also report that the specific stimulatory effect of CDX1 on the Glc6Pase TATA-box, compared to CDX2, is related to the fact that CDX1, but not CDX2, can interact with the TATA-binding protein.

More detailed analysis of the cis-regulatory elements of this 0.7-kb Cdx1 promoter region revealed that two Wnt/beta-catenin responsive elements are important for initiation of Cdx1 expression in the primitive streak and one retinoic acid response element for maintenance.

In addition, the detection of miR-296-5p and expression of CDX1 in primary GC tissues and adjacent IM tissues revealed that miR-296-5p is inversely correlated with CDX1, further supporting our in vitro results.

These results indicate that aberrant methylation of the CpG island in the CDX1 promoter is one of the mechanisms that mediate CDX1 down-regulation in colorectal cancer cell lines.

Conversely, overexpression of Cdx1 decreased cell death in CD44(+) CD24(+) p53wt cells.

Moreover, methylation-specific PCR data revealed that H2O2 treatment increased CDX1 promoter methylation, and treatment with 5-Aza-dC reversed this effect, suggesting that an epigenetic regulatory mechanism triggered by ROS-induced methylation may be involved in CDX1 expression.

Our data have revealed a previously undefined role of CDX1 during epicardial development, and suggest that transient expression of CDX1 promotes epicardial EMT, whereas subsequent down-regulation of CDX1 after 11.5 dpc in mice is necessary for further subepicardial invasion of EPDCs and contribution to coronary vascular endothelium or smooth muscle cells.

In experimental minimal change disease, ZHX3 was transiently down-regulated prior to the onset of proteinuria, and recovery of expression was associated with migration of ZHX3 protein into the nucleus and the development of proteinuria.

Although the expression of genes encoding structural myelin proteins, such as periaxin, myelin basic protein, and myelin protein zero, was decreased, genes associated with a negative regulation of myelination, including c-Jun, Sox2, and Id2, were up-regulated in Miz1ΔPOZ mice compared with controls.

One of the seven lignin-carbohydrate fractions isolated from LEM (Fr4) enhanced the expression of dectin-2 (4.2-fold) and toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 (2.5-fold) prominently, but only slightly modified the expression of dectin-1 (0.8-fold), complement receptor 3 (0.9-fold), TLR1, 3, 4, 9 and 13 (0.8-to 1.7-fold), spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) b, zeta-chain (TCR) associated 70 kDa protein kinase (Zap70), Janus tyrosine kinase (Jak) 2 (1.0-to 1.2-fold), nuclear factor (Nf) кb1, NFкb2, reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog (Rel) a, Relb (1.0-to 1.6-fold), Nfкbia, Nfкbib, Nfкbie, Nfкbil2 and Nfкbiz (0.8-to 2.3-fold).

Molecular docking simulation of importin (ZoIMPα), an important protein involved in nuclear translocation, into the NLS of ZoCDPK1 was well-visualized.

Severe sustained knockdown of ZHX3 caused down-regulation of genes involved in focal sclerosis, including WT1 mediated mostly by increased nuclear entry of ZHX2 and ZHX1.

The RNA-binding properties can be traced to two regions: the Zinc finger domains in the NHR4, which mediate Zinc-dependent RNA binding, and a novel short basic region (SBR) upstream of the NHR2, which mediates Zinc-independent RNA binding.

The Miz-1 POZ domain mediates both self-association and the recruitment of non-POZ partners.

Here we identify Nac1 as a novel interacting partner of the POZ-domain transcriptional activator, Miz1 (Myc-interacting zinc-finger protein 1), and using chemical crosslinking we show that this association is mediated by a heterodimeric interaction of the Nac1 and Miz1 POZ domains.

miR-889 was identified as a novel MICB-targeting miRNA and overexpression of miR-889 significantly inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of MICB in HepG2 and SMMC7721 HCC cells.

By expressing HLA-B,27:05, 6-like, and 9 alleles on a restrictive rat transporter associated with antigen processing background, we demonstrate that a tyrosine expressed at p116, either alone or together with an aspartic acid residue at p114 inhibited HLA-B27 dimerization and increased the assembly rate.

Initially generated transgenic T cells specifically recognized STEAP1(130)-pulsed or transfected cells in the context of HLA-A,02:01 with minimal cross-reactivity as determined by specific interferon-γ (IFNγ) release, lysed cells and inhibited growth of HLA-A,02:01(+) ES lines more effectively than HLA-A,02:01(-) ES lines.

Finally, the HLA-B44 photoaffinity labeling, unlike the HLA-A1 and HLA-A29 labeling, was inhibited more efficiently by the corresponding MAGE decapeptides, which is consistent with the reported HLA-B44 peptide-binding motif (glutamic acid in P2, and C-terminal tyrosine or phenylalanine).

Experiments performed in the presence of antibodies against CD8 showed that CTLp directed against HLA-B antigens were significantly less inhibited by anti-CD8 compared with CTLp against HLA-A.

Using HLA-B,14/peptide-saporin-conjugated tetramers, we show that HLA-B,14-EL9 is substantially more potent at inhibiting viral replication than HLA-B,14-DA9.

ROS scavenging had an insignificant effect on genotoxic drug-induced MICA/B expression but modestly inhibited radiation-induced MICA/B expression.

Of interest is the finding that IL-15- and type I IFN-mediated induction of MICA/B in healthy donors is completely inhibited when DCs are incubated in the presence of anti-IFN-alpha/betaR or anti-IL-15Ralpha, respectively, suggesting interdependent roles of these cytokines in MICA/B expression.

Whereas normal-sized HLA-C was most effective at inhibiting activation by normal-length MICA, only elongated HLA-C could inhibit activation by elongated MICA.

In conclusion, the results of the present study support the hypothesis that ADAM15 is involved in MICB shedding of PANC-1 cells and that gemcitabine inhibits MICB ectodomain shedding through the suppression of ADAM15.

Soluble MHC Ags and anti-Id (anti-anti-MHC) Abs have both been shown to inhibit MHC alloantigen-specific B cell responses in vivo.

The specificity of this direct interaction between peptide-loaded HLA-Cw4 on RMA-S cells and soluble KIR cl42 correlated with recognition by NK clones in that they were inhibited only by HLA-Cw4 loaded with the appropriate peptides.

beta 2-microglobulin aided the MHC tumor inhibition but did not inhibit tumor without the MHC.

We and others have previously shown that small synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of certain MHC class I molecules can inhibit the CTL response against MHC class I alloantigens in vitro.

(iii) IFN-gamma-induced transcription of the HLA-B gene was not inhibited by anisomycin or cycloheximide, but the accumulation of HLA-B transcripts plateaued sooner.

For peripheral blood NK clones, there were specific thresholds in the level of target cell HLA-C needed to inhibit cytotoxicity and to cause segregation of HLA-C from ICAM-1 at the synapse.

BCG85C5 also enhanced MHC-II surface expression of MΦs by inhibiting MARCH1 ubiquitin ligase that degrades MHC-II.

Exposure of beta cells to IFN-γ increased MHC class II gene expression, and blocking IFN-γ signaling in beta cells inhibited MHC class II upregulation.

Recently, it has been shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) do not express the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II antigen and are able to inhibit proliferation of MHC-mismatched stimulated lymphocytes, enabling their use as in vivo allogeneic transplants.

Here, we report that LANA down-regulates MHC II expression and presentation by inhibiting the transcription of MHC II transactivator (CIITA) promoter pIII and pIV in a dose-dependent manner.

IMPORTANCE Due to the near monomorphic nature of MHC-E in the human population and inability of many pathogens to inhibit MHC-E-mediated peptide presentation, MHC-E-restricted T cells have become an attractive vaccine target.

In vitro stimulation of blood lymphocytes from a panel of HLA-B8-positive or HLA-Cw6-positive virus carriers, using autologous cells pulsed with the Zta peptides comprising the HLA-B8 or HLA-Cw6 epitope, respectively, revealed in both cases that most of these donors developed a Zta-specific cytotoxic activity.

2 DS-related SZ and the major role of MHC locus in the risk to develop SZ.

The Zap-70 mutation alters the sensitivity of developing T cells to thymic positive/negative selection by self-peptides/MHC complexes, shifting self-reactive TCR repertoire to include a dominant arthritogenic specificity and also affecting thymic development and function of autoimmune suppressive regulatory T (Treg) cells.

Many studies, however, have demonstrated that a large majority of HLA-B,15:02 individuals are unlikely to develop the adverse drug reaction while on CBZ.

Using 6600 generated decoys and the Z score optimization criterion proposed in this work, the developed potential yielded an acceptable correlation of R(2) = 0.77, with binding free energies determined for known MHC I complexes (Class I Major Histocompatibility protein HLA-A(,) 201) which were not present in the training set.

Absorption of sera with HLA-Cw5-positive lymphoid cells removed HLA-Cw5 and HLA-Cw8 specificities but spared HLA-B14.

Absorption of HLA-B14 antisera with HLA-B14/Cw8-positive cells removed HLA-Cw5, HLA-Cw8, and HLA-B14 reactivities.

HLA-C-mediated immunity may be particularly protective because HIV-1 is unable to remove HLA-C from the cell surface, whereas it can avoid HLA-A- and HLA-B-mediated immunity by Nef-mediated down-modulation.

We found that high set point viral loads (sVLs) were not associated with the emergence of Nef variants that had acquired the ability to down-modulate HLA-C or were more effective in removing HLA-A and HLA-B from the cell surface.

Therefore, HLA-B genotyping could be helpful in preventing serious problems attributable to allopurinol treatment, although PCR-SBT HLA-B genotyping is time consuming.

Based on this case, we hypothesised that if all HLA-B,15:02 carriers were prevented from CBZ prescription, another common HLA-B75 serotype marker would show its association with CBZ-SJS.

In particular, the oncogenic protein PEBP2-beta-SMMHC prevents RUNX1/p300 phosphorylation by sequestering HIPK2 to mislocalized RUNX1/beta-SMMHC complexes.

DM catalyzes peptide loading, whereas DO, an MHCII substrate mimic prevents DM from interacting with MHCII, resulting in an altered MHCII-peptide repertoire and increased MHCII-CLIP.

These studies suggested that HLA-B,5701 holds promise as a screening test to prevent AHS, but concern arose from HLA-B,5701-negative cases with a clinical diagnosis of AHS, and particularly from early reports of apparently low sensitivities of HLA-B,5701 for AHS in patients of non-White race.

Additionally, 5-FU could increase MICA expression on HepG-2 or A549 cells and prevent membrane MICA from shedding as soluble MICA, which were abrogated in the tumor cells transfected with ADAM 10 overexpression plasmid.

We rationally designed antibodies targeting the MICA α3 domain, the site of proteolytic shedding, and found that these antibodies prevented loss of cell surface MICA and MICB by human cancer cells.

TT-1 not only up-regulated MHC class I-related chain molecules A (MICA) expression, but also prevented the secretion of soluble MICA (sMICA).

Our data furthermore demonstrate the importance of specific and exact trimming of peptides to be presented on MHC class II, suggesting that the presentation of cryptic epitopes is favored or prevented by existence of multiple MHC-binding motifs within a certain amino acid sequence, which can result in different or altered T cell reactions.

One of these, KIR049-4, was an inhibitory KIR3DL that bound MHC-I tetramers and prevented activation, degranulation, and cytokine production by macaque NK cells after engagement with specific MHC-I molecules on the surface of target cells.

In contrast, down-regulated or altered MHC-I expression as frequently observed during virus infection or on malignant cells prevents ligation of inhibitory receptors and MHC-I paralyzing inhibition and thus inducing lysis of the target cell.

Summary One function of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-associated invariant chain (Ii) is to prevent MHC class II molecules from binding endogenously generated antigenic epitopes.

Science community believes that the presence of a polymorphism in the CCR5 gene, which is related to chronic inflammatory state, could confer a higher survival rate and a lower number of inflammatory events to these patients since the deletion in CCR5Δ32 would knock out the CCR5 gene.

Altered CCR5 expression in microbial infection and immune related diseases have been reported by several researchers but the role of CCR5 promoter polymorphisms and CCR5 Δ 32 mutation in Iranian patients suffering from these diseases are controversial.

T-tropic SIV strains required the second extracellular loop of CCR5 whereas a closely related M-tropic SIV strain could, like M-tropic HIV-1 strains, use the amino-terminal domain of CCR5.

Collectively, these findings indicate an important role for CCR5, MIP-1 alpha, and CCR2 in granulomatous inflammation, and that CCR5 and MIP-1 alpha, possibly acting through CCR5, might play a deleterious role in the outcome of chronic L.

We demonstrated that soluble recombinant CCR5-T4L acts as a HIV-1 co-receptor, interacts with wild type CCR5, down-regulates the surface CCR5 expression in human macrophages, and interacts with CCL5 to inhibit macrophage migration.

To elucidate the mechanism of NF-κB activation by maraviroc, we have evaluated in HeLa P4 C5 cells, which stably express CCR5, whether maraviroc could be acting as a partial CCR5 agonist, with no other mechanisms or pathways involved.

These studies suggest that the V3 loop protects HIV from neutralization by antibodies prevalent in infected humans, that CCR5 inhibitors likely act by disrupting interactions between the V3 loop and the coreceptor, and that altered use of CCR5 by HIV-1 associated with increased sensitivity to changes in the N-terminal domain can be linked to high levels of resistance to these antiviral compounds.

The demonstration that individuals with a 32-bp deletion within the CCR5 locus were resistant to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, while those heterozygous for the mutation progressed more slowly led to the discovery of maraviroc (MVC), a CCR5 antagonist.

More importantly, two intravenous inoculations of CCR5-expressing BoHV-4 virions into rabbits led to the production of anti-CCR5 antibodies capable of reacting with the CCR5 receptor exposed on the surface of HEK293T cells through specific recognition of the amino-terminal region (aa 14-34) of the protein.

The importance of CCR5 in HIV led to recent genetic engineering of humans to recreate a non-functional CCR5 gene.

In patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) we observed protection from inflammation-associated mortality in CCR5Δ32 carriers leading to CCR5 deficiency, suggesting impact of CCR5Δ32 on inflammatory processes.

Compared with controls, carriers of a polymorphism in the Ccr5 gene that leads to the lack of CCR5 in the cell surface had an increased mean percentage of EPCs, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

In contrast, the loss of the CCR5 ligand, CCL3 led to an early delay in tumor growth that did not persist, while the absence of the CCR5 ligand, CCL5, had no effect.

The blockade of Th1 chemokine receptors using TAK-779, a dual blocker for CXCR3 and CCR5 led to reduced numbers of CXCR3+CD4+ and CCR5+CD4+ T-cells in BALF.

Finally, the minimal levels of cross-resistance suggests that recognition of the MVC-modified form of CCR5 does not necessarily lead to recognition of other antagonist-modified forms of CCR5.

Genetic analysis has revealed the importance of chemokine receptor genes in the disease progression, and the identification of genetic polymorphisms such as alterations in the CCR5 gene that prevent surface expression leads explaining why some people with CCR5 mutation are protected from HIV infection.

There were conserved uncharged residues at position 11 of V3 (mostly serine/glycine) and negatively charged residues at residue 25 (mostly glutamic/aspartic acid) among all isolates that used CCR5, whereas substitution with arginine or glutamine at these two positions led to usage of a co-receptor other than CCR5.

The role of CCR5 in HIV infection led to the development of specific and potent CCR5 antagonists.

MD simulations suggested that the screened compounds retained the important common binding mode known for CCR5 inhibitors (maraviroc and nifeviroc), which occupied the bottom of a pocket and stabilized the conformation of CCR5.

On the contrary, Tpl2 was required to maintain the basal expression of CCR2 and CCR5 as well as to stabilize CCR5 mRNA expression.

Small-molecule CCR5 inhibitors such as vicriviroc (VVC) and maraviroc (MVC) are allosteric modulators that impair HIV-1 entry by stabilizing a CCR5 conformation that the virus recognizes inefficiently.

We observed that TAK779 and MVC are full and weak inverse agonists for CCR5, respectively, indicating that they stabilize distinct CCR5 conformations with impaired abilities to activate G-proteins.

We mutated conserved amino acids to generate constitutively active CCR5 receptors, which are stabilized in active conformations, and tested the ability of constitutively active CCR5 receptors to mediate HIV envelope-directed membrane fusion.

Exposure of FRT DCs to HIV induced secretion of CCL2, CCR5 ligands, interleukin (IL)-8, elafin, and secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor (SLPI) within 3 h of exposure, whereas classical pro-inflammatory molecules did not change and interferon-α2 and IL-10 were undetectable.

Here, we have disrupted the CCR5 locus of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using specific zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) combined with homologous recombination.

We have used this system to identify zinc-finger nucleases that exhibit high cleavage activity (up to 60 % indels) at their targets within the CCR5 and HBB genes and strong discrimination against homologous sequences within CCR2 and HBD.

Here, we used a previously characterized ZFN pair targeting the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) locus to introduce, as a proof of concept, the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) or the microdystrophin genes into human myoblasts.

Fourth, a minimal insert region (amino acids 310 to 518) was found to be sufficient to convert the SL-CoV S from non-ACE2 binding to human ACE2 binding, indicating that the SL-CoV S is largely compatible with SARS-CoV S protein both in structure and in function.

We conclude that HNF1α can induce the expression of ACE2 in pancreatic islet cells via evolutionarily conserved HNF1 binding sites in the ACE2 promoter.

In 3 T3-L1 adipocytes, E2 promoted ACE2 mRNA abundance through effects at estrogen receptor-α (ERα) and resulted in ERα-mediated binding at the ACE2 promoter.

The structure reveals CV30\s epitope overlaps with the human ACE2 receptor binding site thus providing the structural basis for its neutralization by preventing ACE2 binding.

ACE1/ACE2 imbalance occurs due to the binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2, reducing ACE2-mediated conversion of Ang II to Ang peptides that counteract pathophysiological effects of ACE1-generated ANG II.

Most ACE2 variants showed a similar binding affinity for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as observed in the complex structure of wild-type ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Here, we present cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length human ACE2 in the presence of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 with or without the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the surface spike glycoprotein (S protein) of SARS-CoV-2, both at an overall resolution of 2.9 angstroms, with a local resolution of 3.5 angstroms at the ACE2-RBD interface.

Crystal structures of each nanobody-RBD complex revealed how both nanobodies recognize the same epitope, which partly overlaps with the ACE2 binding surface, explaining the blocking of the RBD-ACE2 interaction.

To understand the compatibility of this mechanism with ACE2-receptor interactions, we carried out binding measurements and determined cryo-EM structures of the spike recognizing up to three ACE2 molecules at both physiological and endosomal pH.

Five mutations drawn from ACE2 orthologs of nine Rhinolophus species enhanced human ACE2 binding to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by an immunoadhesin form of human ACE2 (ACE2-Fc).

These include the different levels of the ubiquitously present human angiotensin I converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors gene expression and its variant alleles, the different binding affinities of ACE2 to the virus spike (S) protein given its L- and S-subtypes and the subsequent extent of innate immunity-related hypercytokinemia.

Structural comparisons allowed classification into categories: (1) VH3-53 hNAbs with short CDRH3s that block ACE2 and bind only to up RBDs, (2) ACE2-blocking hNAbs that bind both up and down RBDs and can contact adjacent RBDs, (3) hNAbs that bind outside the ACE2 site and recognize up and down RBDs, and (4) Previously-described antibodies that do not block ACE2 and bind only up RBDs 9.

Inactivation of ACE2 following binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to ACE2-R in situ might blunt ACE2-moderating effects upon ACE CNS neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration.

All tested bat SARSr-CoV spike proteins had a higher binding affinity to human ACE2 than to bat ACE2, although they showed a 10-fold lower binding affinity to human ACE2 compared with their SARS-CoV counterpart.

We reviewed the most recent evidence regarding ACE2 distribution and action, the binding mechanism of COVID-19 and its correlation to cellular injury, ACE2 polymorphisms and its association to fatal COVID-19 and susceptibility and, finally, current ACE2-based pharmacotherapies against COVID-19.

We designed and evaluated in HLA-class I transgenic mouse models a hepatitis C virus (HCV) T cell-based MVA vectored vaccine expressing three viral antigens known to be targets of potent CD8+- and CD4+-mediated responses.

Using tissue microarrays of DSRCT and synovial sarcoma tumor samples, we detected tumoral HLA-A/B/C, beta-2-microglobulin(B2M), and PD-L1 expression, and quantified tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes expressing CD4, CD8, CD56, CD45RO, or FOXP3 by immunohistochemistry.

Increased proportions of NK and CD4 T cells expressed KIR3DL2 in HLA-B,27:05+ AS patients compared with HLA-B,27:05+, HLA-B,27:09+ and HLA-B27- healthy controls.

Under steady-state conditions, the midbrain presented a high immune-alert state characterized by the presence of two unique microglial subpopulations, one expressing the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and acting as antigen-presenting cells and another expressing the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and by the presence of a higher proportion of infiltrating CD4+ T cells.

The human cluster determinant 4 (CD4)  expressed primarily on the surface of T helper cells, serves as a coreceptor in T-cell receptor recognition of MHC II antigen complexes.

MHC class II (MHC-II) molecules function by binding peptides derived from either self or foreign proteins and expressing these peptides on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) for recognition by CD4 T cells.

Peptide vaccination of mice devoid of mouse MHC and transgenic for human MHC class I and II with IDH1(R132H) p123-142 results in an effective MHC class II-restricted mutation-specific antitumour immune response and control of pre-established syngeneic IDH1(R132H)-expressing tumours in a CD4(+) T-cell-dependent manner.

The majority of CD4+ TCL were CD45+ expressed low class II MHC, and exhibited an aggressive clinical course independent of treatment regimen (median survival, 159 \240\days).

Using reaggregated thymic organ culture and bone marrow chimeras, we demonstrate that positive selection of mouse iVα19 transgenic and Vβ6 transgenic MAIT cell progenitors requires MHC-related 1-expressing CD4(+) CD8(+) double positive thymocytes, whereas thymic B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cell subsets are dispensable.

In addition, minor αβT cells bearing invariant TCRs, NKT cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells are selected via MHC-like molecules, CD1d, and MR1 complexed with nonpeptide Ags, respectively, parts of which express neither CD4 nor CD8.

CD4 is a transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily expressed on developing thymocytes, major histocompatibility class II (class II MHC) restricted mature T lymphocytes and, in humans, on cells of the macrophage/monocyte lineage.

Employing a fluorescence-activated cell sorter, DC, identified by the absence of membrane markers for T, B, natural killer (NK) and monocytic cells and by high levels of MHC class II DR antigen, were shown to express low levels of CD4.

CD4, a cell-surface glycoprotein expressed on a subpopulation of T cells, is the receptor for class II molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC II) and a receptor for the envelope glycoprotein (gp 120) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1).

CD4 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on the surface of a variety of cells of the immune system and is believed to participate in the interactions of these cells with antigen-presenting cells bearing the class II major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens.

Both murine CD8+ and CD4+ T cells expressing hCD8 transgenes exhibited markedly enhanced responses to foreign HLA class I, revealing the ability of T cell receptor repertoires selected on either murine class I or class II to recognize human class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC).

However, when the TCR transgenic mouse was developed with a HLA-A2 background, the transgenic TCR was primarily expressed by CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) double-negative T cells.

In addition, Gp120-Texo vaccine also induces Gp120-specific preventive, therapeutic (for 6 day tumor lung metastasis) and CD4(+) T cell-independent long-term immunity against B16 melanoma BL6-10(Gp120/A2Kb) expressing both Gp120 and A2Kb (α1 and α2 domains of HLA-A2 and α3 domain of H-2K(b)) in Tg HLA-A2 mice.

The mAb Foxp3-#32 selectively recognizes CD4\240\+\240\CD25\240\+\240\CD127low and Foxp3\240\+\240\Tregs also expressing HLA-A,02:01 and depletes these cells via antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity.

Here, using CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells that had been gene modified with a retroviral vector expressing HLA-A,24:02-restricted and Wilms\ tumor 1 (WT1)-specific TCR-α/β genes and siRNAs for endogenous TCRs (WT1-siTCR/CD4(+) T cells and WT1-siTCR/CD8(+) T cells), we examined the utility of this strategy.

In the HLA-B27-transgenic rat model of spondylarthropathy, mature B27 molecules expressed by DCs impair the formation of an antigen-independent immunologic synapse with naive CD4+ T cells by interfering with the engagement of costimulatory molecules.

The presence of CD4+ T cells is required, and antigen presenting cells (APC) expressing high levels of HLA-B27 likely play an important role.

Interestingly, three of the CD4+ T-cell lines only responded to cells expressing HLA-B27, irrespective of their restricting allele, implicating HLA-B27 as a possible source of peptides presented by the stimulatory MHC class I alleles.

Thus, we characterize flucloxacillin-responsive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with liver injury and show that naive CD45RA+CD8+ T cells from volunteers expressing HLA-B,57:01 are activated with flucloxacillin when dendritic cells present the drug antigen.

Among the C-clade-infected individuals, we show that HLA-B,52:01 is the most protective of all the HLA-B alleles expressed in the Indian cohort and is associated with the highest absolute CD4 counts.

The anti-tumor response also relied on direct CD4 T cell recognition as only tumors expressing MHC-II were rejected.

BALB/c mice, making a CD4+ Th2 (IL-4+) cell response express both MHC class II antigens (IA(d), IE(d)) and are atherosclerosis-resistant.

As evaluated by FACS, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein A (MICA) was the ligand expressed earlier on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in 90 % of the donors tested, while UL16-binding protein-1 (ULBP) 1, ULBP2, and ULBP3 were induced at later times in 55 %-75 % of the donors.

We demonstrated that MICA is expressed in endothelial cells, keratinocyes and monocytes, but not in CD4+, CD8+ or CD19+ lymphocytes.

However, NKG2D-ligand (major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related molecule A/B (MICA/B)) was preferentially expressed by HBV-specific CD4+ T cells of CHB patients, making these cells a potential target to NKG2D-dependent CD8+CD28- T-cell killing.

In muscle biopsy specimens from PM patients expression of the NKG2D ligand MICA/B was upregulated, IL-15 was expressed by muscle cells, CD68+ macrophages as well as CD4+ T cells, and CD8+NKG2D+ cells were frequently detected within inflammatory infiltrates arguing for a local signaling circuit in the inflammatory muscle milieu.

Conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells express the αβ TCR and recognize peptide antigens in the context of MHC presentation.

Here we show that spontaneous and immunotherapy-induced anti-tumour responses require the activity of both tumour-antigen-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, even in tumours that do not express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules.

Antigenic peptide-loaded MHC class II molecules (peptide-MHC class II) are constitutively expressed on the surface of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells, B cells, macrophages and thymic epithelial cells, and are presented to antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells.

MHC-I antigens were expressed in the sarcolemma and/or sarcoplasm in 79.4 % of PM cases, 62.5 % of DM cases, and 27.6 % of controls (CD4 expression was observed in 76.5 %, 75 %, and 13.8 %, respectively).

Class-I MHC-restricted T cell-associated molecule (CRTAM) is a protein expressed by activated natural killer T (NKT) cells, natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 T cells, and certain CD4 T lymphocytes.

Furthermore, although the itk(-/-) innate PLZF(+) CD4(+) T cells express αβ TCRs, neither β2-microglobulin-dependent MHC class I nor any MHC class II molecules are required for their development.

Most importantly, the acetylated peptide-reactive CD4 HTLs recognized the corresponding naturally processed posttranslational modified epitope presented by either dendritic cells loaded with tumor cell lysates or directly on tumors expressing p53 and the restricting MHC class II molecules.

Finally, we demonstrated that these NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific CD4(+) T cell lines directly lysed autologous melanoma cell lines expressing NY-ESO-1 in an MHC class II restricted manner.

The results of the study indicate an increase in the percentage of CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD25+ T cells, and cells expressing MHC class II molecules, and in the concentration of ceruloplasmin, activity of superoxide dismutase and the concentration of IL-2 in the groups that received copper, particularly copper-glycine chelates.

We identified significantly larger populations of CD4+ and CD4- CD8- (double negative, DN) TCRβ+ cells expressing NKG2D or NKG2A/C/E in Jα18-/- MHCII-/- mice compared with CD1d-/- MHCII-/- mice, suggesting that 30 %-50 % of these cells were type II NKT cells.

This problem was studied here by transferring TCR transgenic CD4 T\240\cells into recipient mice that constitutively express a cognate self-antigen linked to MHC II on CD11c-bearing cells.

Both macrophages and activated CD4+ T cells can be productively infected by HIV-1, and both cell types express MHC class II molecules.

DC from both sources were isolated by digestion with collagenase, disruption of cellular complexes with a chelating agent, selection of light density cells, immunomagnetic bead depletion of other cell types (without depletion with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8) and finally sorting for cells expressing high levels of class II MHC.

Upon activation, CD4+ T cells, the primary target of HIV infection express the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) and therefore the MHC class II isotype, HLA-DR.

Follicular dendritic cells (FDC), B lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells like macrophages, and activated CD4(+) T cells are abundant in lymphoid tissues, and all express substantial levels of the HLA-DR determinant of the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II).

The combination therapy significantly attenuated progression of UC by decreasing incidence of diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, IL-13, IL-6, TNF-α, STAT-3, caspase-3, and MPO activity and significantly increased IL-10, ZO-1, colon length, and GSH content, and these effects were more superior to single drugs.

Additionally, we provide evidence that IL-21-mediated JAK/STAT signals regulate increase in the Zta expression.

Western blot assay showed the protein expression of STAT3, JAK, JAK2 phosphorylated STAT3, phosphorylated JAK1 and phosphorylated JAK2 decreased, while that of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 increased in HL-60 cells after DAC treatment.

However, STAT1 and STAT5, which also exist in a constitutively phosphorylated state in v-src-transformed 32 Dcl3 cells, do not coimmunoprecipitate with v-Src, suggesting that these proteins either interact weakly with v-Src or are phosphorylated by a mechanism distinctive from that of STAT3.

The results showed that stimulation with IL-2 resulted in increased mRNA and protein expression of STAT 5 a phosphorylated STAT 5, JAK 3, and phosphorylated JAK 3.

These findings suggest that NK cells lacking inhibitory receptors to HLA-C and-E kill HIV-infected CD4+ T cells, and they indicate that the capacity of NK cells to destroy HIV-infected cells depends on the ability of the virus to modulate MHC class I molecules.

This constitutes the first demonstration of a gender-specific association between MICA-STR polymorphism and NPC, which could largely be attributable to the underlying gender-related mechanisms that modulate MICA gene expression.

conversely, miR-19a or miR-19b-1 inhibition by the miRNA inhibitor upregulated the aforementioned MHC Class I gene expression, suggesting that miR-19a or miR-19b-1 negatively modulates MHC Class I gene expression.

Here, we show that, in addition to transcriptional regulation of MHC-II, the parasite modulates the expression of key components of the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway, namely, the MHC-II-associated invariant chain (Ii or CD74) and the peptide editor H2-DM, in professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs).

This interference can affect the trafficking of recently peptide-loaded MHC-I from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface, thus modulating the presentation of viral peptides, as well as the recycling of pre-existing cell surface MHC-I, resulting in reduction of the level of overall MHC-I cell surface expression.

The report of three such structures involving viral epitopes that are immunodominant in HLA-B27-restricted T cell responses against influenza, Epstein-Barr and HIV viruses significantly improves our perception of critical aspects of the immunological and pathogenetic roles of HLA-B27, including (1) the molecular basis of its peptide-binding specificity and how this is modulated by subtype polymorphism, (2) the relationship between the structural and the antigenic features of immunodominant viral epitopes, (3) the basis for long term non-progression to AIDS of HIV-infected HLA-B27+ individuals, and (4) the structural features of microbial peptides influencing NK receptor engagement.

Because of the importance of major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and class II antigens in modulating the immune response, we examined the tissue expression of MHC molecules in relation to CNS damage and expression of viral antigens.

Nef downregulates MHC-I by modulating the host membrane trafficking machinery, resulting in the endocytosis and eventual sequestration of MHC-I within the cell.

Mechanistically, entinostat treatment resulted in increased chromatin accessibility to the promoter region for interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1) gene and thereby increasing the transcript and protein levels of IFIT1 that augmented the IFIT1-mediated IRF1, STAT4, and STING pathways.

These results demonstrate that while interferon-γ increases both angiotensinogen and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 expression, STAT1 plays an opposing role in the regulation of each factor in mesangial cells.

Interferon tau (IFNtau), a type I IFN produced by the conceptus trophectoderm increases many type I IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in the ovine uterine endometrial stroma and glandular epithelium (GE) using signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)-dependent pathways.

Addition of platelet-derived growth factor to such transduced cells produces STAT1 activation that is comparable in magnitude and duration to that caused by IFN gamma, but still fails to induce TAP1, IRF1, or class I MHC molecules.

STAT1 induces the expression of CSF-1, which in turn drives TAM proliferation and possibly also the M2 gene signature of MHC-II(lo) F4/80(hi) TAM.

A large amount of work showed that GBP had good antibacterial activity and powerful protective effects against acute hepatic injury induced by carbon tetrachloride and alcohol, as well as antitumor activity, but the safety of GBP was not considered.

Moreover, the gene expression was more profoundly induced by GBP/pCMV-Luc than by pCMV-Luc in both the corpus cavernosum tissue of hypercholesterolaemic mice and in mouse cavernous endothelial cells, although the expression levels induced by the GBP gene delivery system were lower than those induced by the PEI25k gene delivery system.

gondiiIMPORTANCE Guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are induced by the inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-γ) and have been shown to be important factors in the defense of the intracellular pathogen Toxoplasma gondii In previous studies, we showed that members of the mouse GBP family, such as mGBP2 and mGBP7, accumulate at the parasitophorous vacuole of T.

The improved insulin release and glucose tolerance after GBP were shown by others to be blocked by the administration of a GLP-1 antagonist, demonstrating that the favorable metabolic changes after GBP are, in part, GLP-1 dependent.

Furthermore, we found that GBP (1-20 microM) administration inhibited the persistent sodium currents in dose-dependent manner, while the changes of K(+) and Ca(2+) current minimally contributed to the effect of GBP on oscillation and resonant behavior of DRG neurons.

In addition, GBP did not change the basal pain sensitivity and the motor impairment caused by the ITC lesion, suggesting selective action of GBP on the somatosensory system.

Here we show that, in the chimeric protein, the second heterodimerization domain is created by the fusion junction, enabling the chimeric protein to interact with RUNX1 at far greater affinity than PEBP2beta and inactivate the RUNX1/AML1 function.

Two representative RUNX1/LPXN fusion proteins, RL and RLs, were both found to localize in the nucleus and could bring the CBFB protein into the nucleus like the wild-type RUNX1.

This arrangement suggests that RUNX1 could homodimerize to bring and hold together distant chromatin sites and factors and that if the dimerization region is removed by gene fusions or is altered by point mutations, as observed in leukemia, the ability of RUNX1 to regulate differentiation could be impaired.

These CD4(+) T cells recognize a panel of B27-transfected cell lines that are defective in Ag-processing pathways, but not the nontransfected parental cell lines, in a CD4-dependent fashion.

Two CD4+ TLC that recognized K pneumoniae (1 cross-reactive with E coli) as well as 3 TLC that recognized GroEL (2 CD4+, 1 T cell receptor gamma/delta+) were isolated from the SF of a patient with actige AS.

In response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) peptide (pp65) priming, CD4dimCD8bright cells recognized CMV pp65 tetramer approximately 19-fold higher than CD4-CD8+ T cells, indicating that these cells are capable of antigen-specific recognition to a far greater extent than CD4-CD8+ T cells.

In contrast, the mAb PG164A, not only exclusively reacted with CD4-/CD8high lymphocytes, but it also failed to recognize CD4/CD8 double positive lymphocytes.

A CD4-specific mAb (R275) and anti-vFC mAbs, designated F12-1, F13-6 and F18-4 that recognize the epitopes only appeared by the co-culture of env-transfected 293 FT and CD4-transfected 293 cells, were developed by immunizing ganp-gene transgenic mice with an vFC-like structure formed by the same co-culture.

NitraTh had enhanced ability to activate CD4+ T cells and can be recognized by CD4+ T cells with different HLA class II haplotypes.

CD4+ T cells recognized mycobacterial antigens exclusively in the context of the H2-A Class II molecule, and the level of IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells in the lungs was significantly higher in the resistant strain.

This can be provided by CD4 T cells that recognize alloantigen " indirectly" as self-restricted allopeptide, but this process remains unexplained, because the target epitopes for CD4 and CD8 T-cell recognition are " unlinked" on different cells (recipient and donor antigen presenting cells (APCs), respectively).

Using Be-loaded HLA-DP2-peptide tetramers, we identified Be-specific CD4(+) T cells in the mouse lung that recognize identical ligands as CD4(+) T cells derived from the human lung.

The tumor-recognizing CD4(+) T cells more efficiently recognized the short 8-9-mer peptides than the non-tumor-recognizing CD4(+) T cells.

In the murine model, the IA(b) M209 epitope of respiratory syncytial virus is recognized by both CD4(+) Treg and Teff cells, while the IA(b) M226 epitope is recognized almost exclusively by CD4(+) Teff cells expressing high avidity TCR Vβ8.

In 6 patients with metastatic epithelial cancer, this method led to the detection of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells targeting 18 and 1 neoantigens, respectively, compared with 6 and 2 neoantigens recognized by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, when using our standard TIL fragment screening approach.

Cross comparison of mAbs specific for a subset of hamster T cells with a cross reactive mAb known to recognize CD4 in mice and one recognising CD8 revealed they recognize CD4.

The resulting gp140-miniCD4 (gp140-S-S-M64U1) complex was recognized by CD4i antibodies and the HIV-1 co-receptor, CCR5.

Compared with the wild-type Env, the I559P Env was recognized inefficiently by polyclonal sera from HIV-1-infected individuals, by several gp41-directed antibodies, by some antibodies against the CD4-binding site of gp120, and by antibodies that preferentially recognize the CD4-bound Env.

76 : 9888-9899, 2002) suggest that CD4BS antibodies recognize conformations of gp120 distinct from the CD4-bound conformation.

Upon binding to the host cell receptor CD4, gp120 assumes a conformation that is recognized by the second receptor, CCR5 and/or CXCR4, and by the CD4-induced (CD4i) antibodies.

These results indicate that CD4BS antibodies recognize conformations of gp120 different from that recognized by CD4 and CD4i antibodies.

The secreted 2 D CD4 recognized a conformation-dependent anti-CD4 antibody and bound HIV type 1 (HIV-1) gp120, suggesting that the expressed proteins adopted a native conformation.

Here, we report that incorporation of CD4 into HIV-1 viral particles affects Env conformation resulting in the exposure of occluded epitopes recognized by CD4-induced antibodies.

IMPORTANCE It has been well established that Env-CD4 complexes expose epitopes recognized by commonly elicited CD4-induced antibodies at the surface of HIV-1-infected cells, rendering them vulnerable to ADCC responses.

CD4+ and CD8+ CTL were examined to establish whether the same HIV-1 protein (Env, Gag or Pol) was recognized by both CD4+ and CD8+ CTL with MHC antigen restriction.

The mutant proteins lacking the N448 glycan did not effectively stimulate CD4 T cells specific for the nearby C4 epitopes, although the same mutants were recognized well by CD4 T cells specific for epitopes located in the distant C1 and C2 regions.

The survival correlated with the detection of memory CD8(+) splenocytes able to proliferate in vitro upon stimulation with M1 and to bind M1-loaded HLA-A2 dimers, as well as with M1-specific T cells in the lungs, which were directly cytotoxic to influenza-infected cells following influenza challenge.

Recent evidence from transgenic mouse models suggests that CD8 plays a critical role in TCR binding and activation by peptide-MHC complex multimers (tetramers).

A theoretical scheme is proposed by which the type-specific cell surface receptors of T-lymphocytes, CD8 and CD4 bind class I and II MHC proteins in a similar manner.

The scheme has equivalent residues in the C\/C\\ loop-C\\ strand-C\\/D loop region in domain 1 of CD4 and CD8 alpha binding to equivalent residues in the C and D beta-strands and C/D loops in HLA-DR beta 2 (class II) and HLA-A2 alpha 3 (class I) respectively through a series of electrostatic, hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds.

Those who maintain a strong CD4+ T-cell response to CMV are also likely to maintain higher frequencies of CD8+ T cells capable of binding to HLA-A,0201-CMV pp65 (A2-pp65) tetramers as well as responses to pp65 peptide stimulation with effector cytokine production.

CD8 T cells binding to tetramers complexed to HIV gag epitope SLYNTVATL and reverse transcriptase epitope YTAFTIPSI were identified in 9 of 15 and 5 of 12 HLA-A2-expressing seropositive subjects at frequencies of 0.1 % to 1.1 % and 0.1 to 0.7 %, respectively.

The cell surface molecules CD4 and CD8 greatly enhance the sensitivity of T-cell antigen recognition, acting as " co-receptors" by binding to the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules as the T-cell receptor (TCR).

CD4 and CD8 are thought to function as coreceptors by binding to the cognate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules recognized by the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and initiating the signal transduction cascade.

Thus, our studies revealed disparate requirements for CD8 coreceptor expression in the thymus for selection of a T cell repertoire responsive to foreign MHC and to antigenic peptides bound to self-MHC, providing a novel demonstration of positive selection that is dependent on human CD8.

tuberculosis (protein) targets to elicit a CD8(+) or CD4(+) T-cell response is to gauge the binding of candidate peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class II molecules, a prerequisite for successful peptide presentation and to expand antigen-specific T cells.

The level of CD8(+) T cells capable of binding tetramers for the tumor-associated antigen survivin, which is overexpressed in both cancer types, was enumerated in HLA-A,0201 patient samples.

Coagonism in human T cells requires the CD8 coreceptor, but not T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to the nonstimulatory peptide-MHC.

KIRs are regulatory receptors expressed at the surface of NK and CD8+ T-cells that specifically bind HLA-A and-B alleles belonging to the Bw4 supratype and all the-C alleles expressing the C1 or C2 supratype.

The components utilized to construct the minigenes included CD8+ T cell epitopes and (or) anchor modified analogs that were selected on the basis of their predicted binding to HLA-,A0201, their uniqueness in the human proteome, and the likelihood of cancer cell natural processing and presentation via MHC-I.

This work demonstrates the feasibility of using this platform approach with a CD8(+) epitope that binds HLA-B7 and tests the biological activity of potentially protective peptides restricted by human major histocompatibility complex (HLA) class I molecules in HLA transgenic mice.

Inhibitory killer Ig-like receptors (KIR), expressed by human natural killer cells and effector memory CD8(+) T-cell subsets bind HLA-C molecules and suppress cell activation through recruitment of the Src homology 2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1).

The V beta 10-restricted CD8+ T cell response to a defined immunodominant epitope was dramatically reduced in V beta a compared with V beta b mice, as measured either by the expansion of V beta 10 + cells or by the binding of MHC-peptide tetramers.

Five patients developed CD8+ cells binding gp100(280-288) HLA-A2-restricted tetramer.

CD8(+) T cells binding HLA-A,0201/MART-1 pentamers were detected already after 12 days of co-culture in 11/11 donors.

We present evidence that CD8 not only modifies the affinity of cognate TCR/pMHCI binding by altering both the association rate and the dissociation rate of the TCR/pMHCI interaction, but modulates the sensitivity (triggering threshold) of the TCR as well, by recruiting TCR/pMHCI complexes to membrane microdomains at a rate which depends on the affinity of MHCI/CD8 binding.

Finally, we determined whether OOF-specific CD8+ T cells could be found in the peripheral blood of CML patients and whether they could acquire effector function following in vitro sensitization with OOF-derived peptides predicted to bind to human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A2 and HLA-A3 molecules.

pneumoniae elementary bodies and assessment of effector CD8+ T cells allowed us to identify which of the epitopes binding to HLA-A2 in vitro were recognized by C.

Furthermore, a tetrameric HLA-A,0201 complex built with the cruzipain 60-68 peptide that was frequently recognized in the periphery also bound to CD8+ T cells from a heart-infiltrating T cell line obtained from a single patient with Chagas disease cardiomyopathy.

In two A,0206+ donors with CD8+ T-cell response to the peptide, the CD8+ T-cell frequency assessed by specific binding of peptide HLA-A,0201 tetramer was 4.62 % and 1.66 %, respectively.

The CD8 coreceptor of cytotoxic T lymphocytes binds to a conserved region of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules during recognition of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens on the surface of target cells.

The human CD8 functions as a co-receptor for specific T cell recognition, and only one complex structure of human CD8αα binding to HLA-A,0201 has been solved, revealing the molecular basis of CD8 interacting with its ligand pHLA.

A population of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes binding to HLA-A,0201/TMFPHIIVDV pentamers was identified in two HLA-A,0201-positive donors.

We isolated CD8+ T-cell clones binding to peptide-MHC-tetramers composed of HLA-A,02:01 and CD20-derived peptide SLFLGILSV (CD20SLF) from HLA-A,02:01neg healthy individuals to overcome tolerance towards self-antigens such as CD20.

CD8(+) T cell immunodominant epitopes of α-NAC were mapped by applying prediction softwares, and binding affinity was confirmed by stabilization of empty MHC complexes.

This indicates that the substitution at residue 228 affects recognition of CD8-dependent CTL but does not critically affect binding of CD8 to MHC class I molecules, although residue 224 abrogates binding of CD8.

CD8(+) CTL analysis revealed the HTLV-1 Tax peptide sequence to completely lack anchor motifs of peptides binding to HLA-A,26B,4002, and B,4006 molecules but to possess one anchor for HLA-B,4801, while the HTLV-1 Env peptide sequence had many anchor motifs for HLA-A,26, B,4002, B,4006, and B,4801 molecules.

Blocking CD8 binding using alpha3 domain mutants of MHC class I results in much reduced signaling and reduced killing of the targets.

In this study, we investigated the CD8(+) T cell response to the BZLF1 Ag of EBV, which includes overlapping sequences of different size that nevertheless conform to the binding motif of the large and abundant HLA-B,44 supertype.

The canonical role of major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecules in antigen presentation involves the recognition of a short peptide of intracellular origin bound to the upper surface of the class I molecule, by CD8(+) T lymphocytes.

The T cell surface glycoprotein CD8 enhances T cell antigen recognition by binding to MHC class I molecules.

We show that human CD8 alphaalpha binds to the MHC class I molecule HLA-A2 with an extremely low affinity (Kd approximately 0.2 mM at 37 degrees C) and with kinetics that are between 2 and 3 orders of magnitude faster than reported for T cell receptor/peptide-MHC interactions.

Furthermore, CD8 alphaalpha had no detectable effect on a T cell receptor (TCR) binding to the same peptide-MHC class I complex.

The tetrameric MHC-peptide complexes specifically bound to the reactive T-cell clone and 0.79 % of CD8(+) T cells in peripheral blood from a seropositive donor.

CD8(+) T cells responding to the 9-mer epitopes were visualized within fresh blood by ELISPOT using free peptide or by binding of HLA-A,0201 tetrameric complexes.

Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) bound peptide ligands play a major role in dictating the specificity and activation of CD8+ T cells and hence are important in developing T cell-based immunotherapies.

This was demonstrated by the observation that histocompatibility 2, Q region locus 10 (H2-Q10) is a high-affinity ligand for CD8αα which also binds the MHC-Ib molecule H2-TL.

Measurable CD8+ T cell responses elicited by model or viral antigens are always directed against epitopes possessing strong binding affinity for the restricting MHC I alleles.

CD8+ T cells can detect and destroy malignant cells by binding to peptides presented on cell surfaces by MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class I molecules.

The coreceptor CD8αβ can greatly promote activation of T cells by strengthening T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to cognate peptide-MHC complexes (pMHC) on antigen presenting cells and by bringing p56Lck to TCR/CD3.

As experimentally mapping an optimal CD8 T-cell epitope is a tedious procedure, many bioinformatic tools have been developed that predict which peptides bind to a given MHC molecule.

Despite this difference, human, RM, and MCM MHC-E molecules were expressed at similar levels across immune cell subsets, equivalently upregulated by viral pathogens, and bound and presented identical peptides to CD8+ T cells.

I suggest that double (CD4+ CD8+)-positive (DP) developing thymocytes compete with their αβTCRs for binding to self-pMHC on cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) that present a selected set of tissue-restricted antigens.

Class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I)-bound peptide ligands dictate the activation and specificity of CD8+ T cells and thus are important for devising T-cell immunotherapies.

Here we present a model of viral evasion from CD8 T cell immuno-surveillance by a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) escape mutant with an epitope for which TCR affinity for pMHC remains high but where the antigenic peptide binds sub optimally to MHC.

Using NTAmers that were deficient for CD8 binding to pMHC, we found that CD8 itself stabilized the TCR-pMHC complex, prolonging the dissociation half-life several fold.

MHC class I (MHC-I)-bound ligands play a pivotal role in CD8 T cell immunity and are hence of major interest in understanding and designing immunotherapies.

We have reported previously that the cytolytic activity of murine CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for HIV-1 gp160 envelope glycoprotein was markedly inhibited by brief exposure to the free minimal antigenic peptide (I-10: 10 mer peptide from gp160) by direct binding to class I MHC molecules of specific CTL in the absence of antigen-presenting cells (APC).

Because the BB-1-positive fibers expressed MHC-class I antigen and bound to up-regulated counterreceptors CD28 and CTLA-4 on the autoinvasive CD8+ T cells only in PM, HIV-PM, and s-IBM, the BB-1 molecule in these diseases should have a functional role in antigen presentation and T cell differentiation.

Further, seven CD8(+) T cell responses were defined by identifying peptide binding motifs of the three most frequent MHC-I transcripts on the M3 haplotype.

As a T-cell co-receptor, CD8 binds to MHC class I molecules and plays a pivotal role in the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

As a co-receptor, CD8 can bind to the alpha3 domain of the same MHC class I molecules as the TCR to facilitate TCR signaling.

CD8+ T cells recognize MHC class I molecules and after activation produce proteins that destroy infected cells.

Using an HHD model in which HLA-A2(neg) tumor (MC38 colon carcinoma or B16 melanoma) cells are not recognized by the CD8(+) T cell repertoire, we now show that vaccines on the basis of tumor-associated blood vessel Ags (TBVA) elicit protective Tc1-dependent immunity capable of mediating tumor regression or extending overall survival.

We could not detect any increases in CD8+ T cells specifically recognizing HLA-A(,) 201-restricted melanoma epitopes in the peripheral blood.

However, when these TCRs were expressed in CD8- Jurkat cells, the resulting Jurkat cells recognized gp100:209-217 peptide loaded T2 cells and had high functional avidity, but could not recognize HLA-A2+ melanoma cells expressing gp100.

HLA can be divided into (HLA-A, B, and C) which are encoded by class I MHC and are expressed on all cell types and present peptides derived from the cytoplasm and are recognized by CD8+ T cells.

The failure of postvaccination HER2369-377-specific CD8(+) T cells to recognize HLA-A2(pos) HER2/neu-expressing cells in vitro, however, has been attributed to impaired MHC class I/HLA-A2 presentation observed in HER2/neu-overexpressing tumors.

We now show that MAGE-A6172-187 and, even more so, HF-2216-229, induce memory CD8+ T cells that recognize HLA-A2+ MAGE-A6+ tumor target cells.

These results indicate that CD8+ CTL clones that use different TCR and demonstrate two distinct serotype specificities recognize the same 9-mer peptide in the context of HLA-B35.

Decidual CD8(+) T cells are the main candidates to recognize and respond to fetal HLA-C at the fetal-maternal interface, but data on the characteristics of these cells are limited.

Specifically effective cytotoxic CD8+ T‑cell populations are also formed, which recognize viral epitopes as pathogen-specific patterns in combination with MHC presentation on the cell surface of virus-infected cells and destroy these cells.

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecules A (MICA) is a stress-inducible cell surface antigen that is recognized by intestinal epithelial Vdelta1 gammadelta T cells, natural killer (NK) cells and CD8(+) T cells with NKG2D receptor participating in the immunological reaction in the intestinal mucosa.

NKG2D is a major activating immunoreceptor expressed in not only NK cells but also CD8+ T cells and shows cytotoxicity against tumors by recognizing its ligands major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain A and B (MICA and MICB) on tumor cells.

MICA is a stress-induced major histocompatibility complex-related molecule expressed on normal intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and recognized by the NKG2D-activating receptor on CD8(+) T cells, gammadelta T cells, and natural killer cells.

Previous studies have shown that MICA and MICB are expressed on the surface of cells in response to infection, where they are recognized by the NKG2D receptor on gammadelta T cells, CD8+ alphabeta T cells and natural killer cells, all of which contribute to defense against mycobacteria.

MICA protein is up-regulated on different tumor cells, and is recognized by the lectin-like NKG2D molecule expressed by cytotoxic gammadelta T lymphocytes, CD8+ alphabeta T lymphocytes, and NK cells.

MICA-expressing cells are recognized by natural killer (NK) cells, CD8+ abTCR and gdTCR T lymphocytes through the NKG2D receptor.

This mechanism in NK cells is based on the release of granzymes, which activate apoptosis in target cells, while CD8+ NKG2D+ T lymphocytes recognize the noncanonical MicA antigen on the surface of virus-containing cells and kill them via the FasL-Fas interaction, triggering the apoptotic or necroptotic cell death pathway.

An involvement of increased CD4 expression in this enhanced proliferative response was evidenced by the observation that T cell proliferation in CORT-treated cultures was much less sensitive to inhibition by an inhibitory, nondepleting anti-CD4 mAb than that in control cultures.

Importance Escape mutant-specific CD8+ T-cells were elicited in some individuals infected with escape mutants, but it is still unknown that these CD8+ T-cells can suppress HIV-1 replication.

Spontaneous control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is generally associated with an enhanced capacity of CD8+ T cells to eliminate infected CD4+ T cells, but the molecular characteristics of these highly functional CD8+ T cells are largely unknown.

Our previous studies demonstrated that CD8 T cells from chronically infected patients with high virus load proliferated poorly in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), a cytokine critical in CD8 T cell growth and differentiation, even though relatively high levels of IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) were expressed.

Here we show that although HIV-1 produced by CD8+ cells maintained the ability to infect CD4+ cells, these viruses were able to infect CD8+ cells independent of CD4.

Evidence indicates that these viruses used CD8 as a receptor to infect CD8+ cells.

Additionally, HSV-1-specific CD8+ T cells were transferred into HSV-1 latently infected mice to mimic the effect of a therapeutic vaccine, and their migration into trigeminal ganglia (TG) was traced during steady-state latency, or during recovery of the TG-resident memory CD8+ T cell population following stress-, and corticosterone-induced depletion and HSV-1 reactivation from latency.

Transferred HSV-specific CD8+ T cells failed to access latently infected TG during steady-state latency, or during recovery of the TG resident HSV-specific CD8+ T cell population following exposure of latently infected mice to stress and corticosterone.

Our findings are consistent with the notion that the CD8+ T cells in latently infected TG are a tissue-resident memory (Trm) population that is maintained without replenishment from the periphery, and that when this population is disrupted, it recovers without proliferation or detectable recruitment of HSV-specific CD8+ T cells from the blood.

To rule out any possible role for CD8(+) T cells in viral control, we infected mice in which CD8(+) T cells had been removed by a depleting antibody.

To investigate the mechanism and functional significance of infection of CD8+ lymphocytes by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in vivo, we determined frequencies of infection, proviral conformation, and genetic relationships between HIV-1 variants infecting naive (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes.

Overexpression of NKG2A has been observed on CD8+ and NK cells of COVID-19 infected patients compared to healthy controls, while NKG2A overexpression also functionally exhausts CD8+ cells and NK cells, resulting in a severely compromised innate immune response.

We have recently described derivation of Chlamydia-specific human CD8(+) T cells by using infected dendritic cells as a surrogate system to reflect Chlamydia-specific CD8(+) T cell responses in vivo.

These strategies are primarily focused on CD8+ T cells and approaches are challenging due to insufficient HIV antigen production from infected cells and poor HIV-specific CD8+ T cells.

We also compared the epigenetic signatures of the 2 CD8 T cell subsets from chronically infected mice with effector and memory CD8 T cells generated after an acute LCMV infection.

Consistently, a marked reduction of cyst numbers and upregulation of ICOS, CXCR3, CXCR6, IL-18R1, and Chil3 mRNA levels were also detected when the perforin-sufficient CD8+ immune T cells were transferred to infected SCID mice at 6 weeks after infection, indicating that the CD8+ T cell-mediated protective immunity is capable of eliminating mature T.

HIV infection reduces the expression of HLA-A,-B, and-C on the surfaces of infected CD4 (iCD4) T cells.

After intranasal inoculation, it showed a severe defect in salivary gland colonization that was associated with increased MHC II expression on infected cells, and was significantly rescued by CD4+ T cell loss.

Twelve MHC-genotyped MCMs were infected with SIVmac251 and monitored for viral loads and CD4+ T-cell counts.

This cytotoxicity was not MHC class I-restricted, and depletion of CD8+ T lymphocytes from unfractionated PBL cultures shortly after HIV infection largely abolished the killing of the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes.

We have previously shown that IFN-α stimulation augments direct natural killer (NK) cell lysis of autologous CD4 primary T cells infected with certain HIV-1 isolates based upon major histocompatibility complex class 1 (MHC-1) downregulation capacity.

Human CD4+ T cell clones infected in vitro with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), unlike their noninfected counterparts, induced both proliferation and immunoglobulin (Ig) production by both autologous and allogeneic B cells through an antigen (Ag)-nonspecific, MHC-unrestricted, contact-dependent mechanism.

We also identified in all donors CD4 T cells specific for A2/peptide complexes, whose frequencies were not affected by MHC class I expression, but nevertheless correlated with those of their naive CD8 T cell counterparts.

The flow cytometry data indicated that a decreased number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of mice with EAE without affecting the number of T regulatory cells (CD4\240\+\240\CD25+ forkhead box protein 3 +).

In addition, LI-M\ boosting dramatically enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated immunity without affecting the response intensity of CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity.

However, most therapeutic T cell products are generated from lymphocytes, containing CD4+ T cells that can affect CD8+ T cells dependent on the Th-subset.

Also, CD8(+) lymphocyte depletion significantly affected the ability to generate SIV Gag-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses and neutralizing antibodies.

Anti-TIGIT monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were used to block the function of TIGIT in OC mice, and we found that the anti-TIGIT treatment reduced the proportion of CD4+ Tregs, but did not affect CD4+ and CD8+ T cells or natural killer cells.

As a consequence, Hrd1-null DCs failed to prime CD4(+) T cells without affecting the activation of CD8(+) T cells.

However, it is largely unexplored how inflammation-induced MHCII expression by intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) affects CD4(+) T cell-mediated immunity or tolerance induction in vivo.

) In the controls, the challenge dose (10 to 20 50 % monkey infectious doses [ MID(50) ]) or MHC did not affect susceptibility to infection, peak viral load, or acute CD4 T-cell loss, whereas in the chronic phase of infection, the H1 haplotype correlated with a high viral load (P = 0.028) and CD4 loss (P = 0.0343).

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) induced macrophage activation and polarization were significantly suppressed by bilobalide as indicated by reduced expression of cytokine, major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II), and CD11c.

We demonstrated using in vitro models of immune activation that the production of interferon-gamma was specifically induced by abacavir treatment in PBMCs obtained from hypersensitive patients carrying the HLA-B,5701 allele (median 123.86 compared with-30.83 for tolerant controls, P=0.

tuberculosis proteome for potential MHC class II-presented epitopes that could serve as targets for CD4(+) T-cell responses.

The involvement of HLA-class I in target cell lysis by CD4(+) cytolytic T cells (CTL) has been a controversial issue.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in mice of this MHC haplotype primarily target peptides of the spike and membrane proteins, while the antigen-specific CD4+ T cells target peptides of the nucleocapsid, membrane, and spike proteins.

We are exploring immunotherapeutic options for metastatic uveal melanoma using MHC II uveal melanoma cell-based vaccines that target the activation of tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells.

These include major histocompatibility complex-I (MHC I) and (MHC II) present on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and target cells, and CD4 and CD28 present on helper T cells.

We tested the ability of a novel two component adjuvant, CAF01, consisting of the immune stimulating synthetic glycolipid TDB (Trehalose-Dibehenate) incorporated into cationic DDA (Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide) liposomes to induce CD8(+) T-cell restricted cellular immune responses towards subdominant minimal HLA-A0201-restricted CTL epitopes from HIV-1 proteins in HLA-A,0201 transgenic HHD mice.

The naturally occurring non-Ser variant at position 9 of HIV-1 subtype C Nef has recently exhibited an association with enhanced HLA-B downregulation function and decreased susceptibility to recognition by CD8 T cells.

We also found that iNOS inhibition by AG decreased the KRV-induced expression of MHC class II molecules and IL-2R alpha-chain, resulting in the suppression of T cell activation, evidenced by the decreased cytolytic activity of CD8(+) T cells.

sMICA downregulated surface NKG2D in normal peripheral blood CD8(+) cells and decreased NK-mediated killing of MICA(+) NB cells.

In vivo, mAAQ was associated with increased expression of immune modulators PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) and CD86 by myeloid DCs (mDCs) and decreased presentation of allopeptide+self-MHC complexes, along with increased PD-L1, on plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs).

Interestingly, Bm-L3 increased the expression of CD80 and CD86 across all DC subsets but decreased that of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) on mDCs and pDCs, resulting in their impaired antigen uptake and presentation capacities, but maximally attenuated the T-cell proliferation capacity of only mDCs.

Ad-specific CD8+ T cells were detected in PBMC from healthy adults at a mean frequency of 77 per 10 (5) CD8+ T cells (range 8-260) by interferon-gamma ELISPOT and cytokine flow cytometry assays.

HBc18-27-specific CD8 T cells (c18-27-CD8Ts) were detected at a significantly higher prevalence in patients with anti-HBe (6/18) than in those with HBeAg (1/17), and their frequency reached 0.28 % of the total CD8 T cells.

E75 peptide-specific CD8 T cells were detected directly in the peripheral blood of patients by staining with E75-HLA-A2 dimers and CD8 antibodies.

Most autoreactive CD8(+) T cells detected in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients are specific for leader sequence peptides, notably PPI(6-14), whereas CD8(+) T cells in long-standing patients recognize the B-chain peptide PPI(33-42) (B(9-18)).

The WT1+CD8+ CTL and WT1+IFNgamma+ cells did not detected in all 14 donors, but WT1+CD8+ CTL cells in 2 patients and WT1+IFNgamma+ cells in 3 patients could be detected before transplantation respectively, there was no significant difference between them, while the WT1+CD8+ CTL cells and WT1+IFNgamma+ cells both could be detected in all 14 patients after transplantation, the positive detection rate after transplantation was obviously higher than that before transplantation.

The WT1+CD8+ and WT1+ IFNgamma+ cells could be detected within 30 days after transplantation, but the positive detection rate of WT1+IFNgamma+ cells was higher than that of WT1+CD8+ CTL cells (p=0.

CD8+ T cells against dominant and subdominant epitopes were detected upon infection of mice with live H7N3 virus, whereas immunization with non-replicating virus elicited CD8+ T cell responses against mostly immunodominant epitopes, which were rapidly recalled following infection with A/PR/8/34 virus.

In chronic hepatitis C, tetramer(+) CD8(+) T cells were detected at frequencies ranging from 0.05 % to 0.12 % of total CD8(+) T cells.

Similarly, single-agent treatment with FOLR1-TCB induced strong CD8+ T-cell infiltration in HeLa tumors, where 89 Zr-Df-IAB22M2C again was able to detect CD8 tumor infiltrates.

In addition, hypermethylation of CD8A was detected in the morbid ducklings, whereas relatively low methylation of CD8A was evident in the non-morbid ducklings.

Instead our data suggest that survivor cells are not inherently resistant to CD8+ T cell killing, but instead no longer present IAV antigen and cannot be detected by CD8+ T cells.

CD8+T cells were co-cultured with U87 cells to detect the CD8+T proliferation, cell cytotoxic activity, U87 cell activity, as well as IFN-γ and TGF-β1 levels.

Reduced intracellular IFN-γ and IL-2 production by HIV-specific CD8+ T cells was detected in both treated and untreated HIV+ patients, and multifunctional CD8+ T cells simultaneously producing these cytokines were not found in any patient.

As CD8 T cells recognize antigens in the context of class I major histocompatibility complex, the identification of an HLA class I association in HIV-associated psoriasis strengthens the argument for an important role for CD8 + T lymphocytes in the immunopathogenesis of psoriasis.

While our observations of CTL generation are consistent with the prior reports that have demonstrated that specific CD8(+) CTL could be generated which recognize PSA-derived epitopes by in vitro stimulation by one means or another, this observation that IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells are present in patients which are antigen experienced, and do not require in vitro stimulation, is novel and has major implications for prostate cancer vaccine preparation.

This study demonstrates the importance of CD8+ T-cells recognizing HTLV-1 Env-tetramers in HAM/TSP patients and carriers with autoimmune diseases, thereby suggesting that the diversity, frequency and repertoire of HTLV-1 Env-specific CD8+ T-cell clones may be related to the hyperimmune response in HAM/TSP and carriers with autoimmune diseases, although different immunological mechanisms may mediate the hyperimmunity in these conditions.

Further, several epitopes recognized by ECTV-reactive CD8+ T cells were not recognized by VACV-reactive CD8+ T cells, and vice versa.

The fraction (median value) of CD8 T cells recognizing individual EBV epitopes ranged from 0.5 to 2.5 % of CNS-infiltrating CD8 T cells.

Additionally, although CD8+ T cells in PsA have been recognized via flow cytometry as a source of IL-17A production, it is not clear whether CD8+ T cells secrete IL-17A under more physiologically relevant conditions in the context from PsA synovitis.

Of the EBV immune evasion mechanisms identified to date, none could explain why CD8(+) T cell responses to late lytic cycle genes are so infrequent and, when present recognize lytically infected target cells so poorly relative to CD8(+) T cells specific for early lytic cycle antigens.

This study identifies two KSHV CD8 epitopes derived from late-lytic antigens that are recognized by KSHV-seropositive, HIV co-infected individuals, and will be useful in future immunological studies into the CD8 response against KSHV in similar patient cohorts.

Thus, how CD8(+) T cells contribute to overall immunity to tuberculosis and whether antigens recognized by CD8(+) T cells would enhance the efficacy of vaccine strategies continue to be important questions.

A significant γ-interferon CTL response was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 13/31 DLBCL patients following short-term cell stimulation with two novel HLA-A⁎0201 peptides and one previously reported HLA-A⁎0101-restricted nine-mer Sp17 peptide.

The content of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I on T2 cells and the expression of immune molecules on dendritic cells (DC) were detected by flow cytometry, and the concentrations of interleukin (IL)-12 and interferon-gamma were determined by ELISA.

Thus, while stimulation with prostratin restricts susceptibility of primary resting CD4(+) T cells to HIV infection at the virus cell-entry level and at the reverse transcription level, it efficiently reactivates HIV-1 from pre- and postintegration latency in resting CD4(+) T cells.

The plasma viral load, which varied inversely with CD4%, was similar in HIV-1 singly and dually infected patients, but was significantly higher in HIV-1 than in HIV-2 singly infected patients, except in those with a CD4% less than 14 %.

HIV-2 plasma viral load in dually infected patients did not vary significantly with CD4%, but was significantly lower than in HIV-2 singly infected patients with CD4% less than 14 %.

To determine whether this exclusion might lead to ongoing replication, target CD4+ T cell infected CD4+ T cell, free virus, and intracellular IC50 values of anti-retroviral drugs were incorporated into the model.

In vitro infection assays showed transitional memory (TM) and effector memory (EM) CD4+ T cells were more frequently infected (median: 46 % and 25 % of total infected CD4+ T cells respectively) than naïve, stem cell memory, central memory and terminally differentiated cells.

Although it was CD4 independent, the 92 US143-T8 isolate also maintained the ability to infect CD4+ cells.

In this study we show that activation of the CD4 or CCR5 receptor by R5 HIVenv causes a caspase 8-dependent death of both uninfected and infected CD4 T cells.

HIV-1 use CD4 receptors to infect their primary targets, CD4+ cells, whereas CD8+ cells have a protective role against HIV-1.

In contrast to the decline in CD4(+) T cell counts in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the decline in CD4(+) T cell counts in SMs naturally infected with SIV over a 5-year period was not predicted by either plasma viremia or levels of T-cell activation.

CD4+ CTLs clones specific for HIV-1 Nef and Gag are capable of killing HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages.

After an initial depletion of bystander CD4+ memory T cells during acute infection, latently or chronically infected CD4+ T lymphocytes are progressively selected and are protected against spontaneous apoptosis through the development of an efficient survival program.

Replication-competent virus was recovered from pooled resting CD4⁺ T cells in 7 of 16 mice, with a median frequency of 8 (range, 2 to 12) infected cells per million T cells, demonstrating that HIV-1 infection can persist despite ART in the resting CD4⁺ T cell reservoir of hu-Rag2⁻/⁻ γ(c) ⁻/⁻ mice.

Il-27ra-/- CD4+ T cells in the infected recipient mice did not produce IL-10, indicating that IL-10 production by primed CD4+ T cells is IL-27 dependent.

In this study, we co-cultured mice CD4+ T cells with Leishmania donovani infected and uninfected macrophage for the identification of dysregulated miRNAs in CD4+ T cells by next-generation sequencing.

While we and others have previously shown that CD4(+) T cells from ES can be infected by HIV-1 isolates in vitro, these studies were confounded by exogenous activation and in vitro culture of CD4(+) T cells prior to infection.

CMV-specific CD4+ T cells, which are less frequently infected than HIV-specific CD4+ T cells, are a model for such an effect.

Within 48 h post inoculation, however, virus harbored by CD4 negative TERT-2 cells trans infected co-cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or MOLT4 cells (CD4+ CCR5+) by direct cell-to-cell transfer or by releasing low levels of infectious virions.

More importantly, we observed 2 distinct cell tropism phenotypes for pseudoviruses carrying monocyte-derived envelopes: (1) monocyte-derived, macrophage-specific R5 (MDMS-R5) virus that, using CCR5 only, could infect monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) but not CD4(+) T cells and (2) dual tropic virus that infected both MDMs and primary CD4(+) T cells.

Despite such limited CD4 and CCR5 expression, lymphoid tissue pDC were infected to a degree similar to that seen with CD4(+) T cells in both MAC and AGM.

SIVmac239 with N173Q mediated CD4-independent cell-cell fusion but could not infect CD4-negative cells in single-round infections.

This new assay utilizes bead and column-based purification of resting CD4(+) T cells from the peripheral blood of HIV-1 infected patients rather than cell sorting to obtain comparable resting CD4(+) T cell purity.

The skewed repartition of resting CD4 subsets influenced their contribution to the pool of resting infected CD4+T cells, two thirds of which consisted of short-lived TTM and TEM subsets, whereas long-lived TN and TCM subsets contributed the balance.

IMPORTANCE In people living with HIV (PLWH) on suppressive ART, latent HIV can be found in a diverse range of CD4+ T cells, including quiescent naive and central memory cells that are typically difficult to infect in vitro It is currently unclear how latency is established in these cells in vivo We show that in CD4+ T cells from PLWH on suppressive ART, the use of the coreceptor CXCR4 was prevalent among viruses amplified from naive and central memory CD4+ T cells.

To quantify SHIV-#64 and-KS661 infection dynamics in Rhesus macaques, we developed a novel approach and analyzed total CD4+ T cells and viral load in peripheral blood, and reproduced the expected dynamics for the uninfected and infected CD4+ T cells in silico.

In a different model where myeloid dendritic cells (mDC) were co-cultured with resting CD4+ T-cells, we observed a higher frequency of latently infected cells in vitro than CCL19-treated or unstimulated CD4+ T-cells in the presence of low dose IL-2.

Taken together, these results indicate that CD4+ cells infected with R5 virus isolates may have a selective advantage over X4 virus-infected CD4+ T cells for survival and, hence, virus spread.

Since this mechanism could potentially allow CD4+/CXCR4-null cells to become infected by T-tropic HIV, we incubated several human CD4+/CXCR4-null cells such as normal erythroblasts, glioblastomas U87, MAGI and hematopoietic cell lines UT-7, HEL and TF-1 with PMP or MegaMP.

We present evidence of the down-regulation of CXCR4 membrane expression in CD4-positive or-negative cells chronically infected with the HIV-1 m7NDK, a phenomenon which is not observed in the CD4-dependent HIV-1 NDK parental strain.

We demonstrated previously that CD45RA(+) CD4(+) T cells are infected primarily by syncytium-inducing (SI) HIV-1 variants, whereas CD45RO(+) CD4(+) T cells harbor both non-SI (NSI) and SI HIV-1 variants.

Although HIV-2 and SIV strains also use CD4, several laboratory-adapted HIV-2 strains infect cells without CD4, via an interaction with the coreceptor CXCR4.

CD4-independent HIV-2 strains that could use both CCR5 and CXCR4 to infect CD4(+) cells were only able to use one of these receptors in the absence of CD4.

FP-21399 is a novel compound of the bis(disulfonaphthalene) dimethoxybenzene class that blocks entry of HIV into CD4+ cells and blocks fusion of infected and noninfected CD4+ cells.

These conclusions were based on studies with a panel of HeLa-CD4 cell clones that differ in CD4 levels over a broad range, with laboratory-adapted viruses infecting all clones with equal efficiencies and primary T-cell-tropic viruses infecting the clones in proportion to cellular CD4 levels.

As reported previously, unrelated LA and PR T-cell-tropic HIV-1 isolates differ in infectivities for the HeLa-CD4 clonal panel, with LA viruses infecting all clones equally and PR viruses infecting the clones in proportion to cellular CD4 quantities (D.

We conclude that T-cell-tropic PR viruses bind weakly to CD4 and preferentially infect cells that coexpress CXCR-4 and large amounts of CD4.

Their laboratory adaptation involves corresponding increases in affinities for CD4 and in abilities to infect cells that have relatively little CD4.

In contrast, macrophage-tropic HIV-1 appears to interact weakly with CD4 although it can infect cells that coexpress CCR-5 and small quantities of CD4.

To determine whether CCL2 alters HIV-1 infection of resting CD4(+) T cells, we infected purified resting CD4(+) T cells after incubation with CCL2.

This analysis indicates that up to 80 % of CD4 T cells are infected at peak viremia and that the proportion of CD4 T cells destroyed is correlated with the peak viral load.

To explore the utility of NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice as an in vivo model to reactivate HIV-1 proviruses from VOA-negative CD4+ T cells, resting CD4+ T cells from an HIV-1 latently infected individual were isolated and the human CD4+ T cells corresponding to VOA-positive and VOA-negative CD4+ T cells were engrafted into NSG mice.

Latently infected cells are very infrequent in CD4+ T cells from antiretroviral (ARV) treated individuals, with only approximately one in a million infected CD4+ T cells in blood.

In contrast, infection of unfractionated PBLs (containing CD8+ as well as CD4+ lymphocytes) with these isolates always resulted in death of the infected CD4+ T lymphocytes.

While the parent Jurkat cells, those transfected with vector alone, and those transfected with CD44E could be productively infected with only the lymphocytotropic strain HIV-1-LAI, cells transfected with CD44S were rendered susceptible to productive infection with the monocytotropic strains HIV-1-BaL and HIV-1-ADA.

Compared with patient X4 viruses, the gp120-gp41 complexes of LA viruses have a constellation of common properties including enhanced affinities for CD4, greater sensitivities to inactivations by diverse antibodies and by soluble CD4, increased shedding of gp120, and improved abilities to infect HeLa-CD4 cell clones that contain only trace quantities of CD4.

We propose that PD-1 blockade therapies have antitumor effects on MHC-II-expressing tumors such as cHL that are mediated by cytotoxic CD4+ T cells and that LAG-3 could be a candidate for combination therapy with PD-1 blockade.

CD4 T cells can differentiate into multiple effector subsets, including ThCTL that mediate MHC class II-restricted cytotoxicity.

Recent reports identified an essential role of Lck in associating with CD4 and CD8 coreceptors and mediating the requirement for MHC restriction in TCR recognition.

TLR-7 and TLR-9 ligands had the most effective adjuvant like effect on MHC-II of APCs which allowed BCG vaccine mediated activation of CD4 T cells.

Measurements indicated that T cell response upon stimulation was associated with IFNγ-induced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II up-regulation on hepatocytes and mediated by CD4+ T cells.

Our investigation shows that PPM provided enhancement of uptake, probably by exploiting the caveolin-mediated endocytosis pathway, endosomal processing, and MHC II presentation to immunopotentiate Chlamydia-specific immune effector responses mediated by CD4+ T cells.

In CD4+ T cells, both TCRs mediated activity against MART-1 presented by HLA-A2.

HLA-DM is essential for editing peptides bound to MHC class II, thus influencing the repertoire of peptides mediating selection and activation of CD4(+) T cells.

Using an in vivo model of CD4+ T-cell mediated immunity against MHC II negative myeloma cells, bystander killing of AgNEG cells was ineffective due to strict spatial constraints of Th1-induced TAM cytotoxicity.

We derived CD4+ T cell lines (STLs) from the human skin graft of immunized mice, showing that STLs mediated an MHC class II-restricted cytolytic activity directed against HIV-LAIgp160 Ags.

Our work aimed to first establish the dynamics and clinical relevance of CD4:CD8 ratio in a cohort of native Africans and then to examine its association with viral and host factors, including: (i) length of infection, (ii) demographics, (iii) HIV-1 viral load (VL), (iv) change in CD4(+) T-lymphocyte count (CD4 slope), (v) HIV-1 subtype, and (vi) host genetics, especially human leukocyte antigen (HLA) variants.

Nevertheless, ablation of CD4+ T-cells alone does not offer the same protection in the adult heart after myocardial infarction, suggesting a developmental change of immune cells including CD4+ T-cells in the regulation of age-related mammalian heart repair.

Commonly used single summary measures, such as viral load set point or early CD4 count, do not explicitly account for changes in viral load or CD4 counts or other features of the overall time course of these measures.

Treatment effects are modelled by positing recoveries in square root of CD4 level proportional to current immuno-competence and changes in slope proportional to current rate of square root of CD4 loss.

Changes in gene expression did not correlate with CD4+ T cell recovery or any changes in the CD4+ T cell maturation, proliferation and activation phenotypes.

Because these cells constitute only a small fraction of CD4+ T cells, their depletion does not substantially change the total CD4+ T-cell count.

Comparing CD4 count change among 4 study groups showed that only CD4 change between Selenium-Levamisole group and control group was significant.

Collectively, these data suggest that increased susceptibility to TB disease could be related to a loss of circulating Th1, CD4+ T cells rather than major changes in the number or function of circulating CD4+ T cells.

We observed several differences between T cell-tropic and macrophage-tropic Env proteins, including functional differences with host CD4 receptor engagement and possible changes in the CD4 binding site and V1/V2 region.

CD4 independence and neutralization sensitivity were both conferred by Env amino acid changes E84K and D470N that arose independently in multiple animals, with the latter introducing a potential N-linked glycosylation site within a predicted CD4-binding pocket of gp120.

In the absence of this constraint and with a relative paucity of CD4(+) target cells, widespread macrophage infection occurs in vivo accompanied by emergence of variants carrying structural changes that enable entry independently of CD4.

Prolonged ART recovered the CD4+ Tscm cells, and the dynamic change of CD4+ Tscm cells was in parallel with CD4+ T cell restoration and a decrease in the level of T cell immune activation.

Considering neutralization sensitivity of these isolates, newly infected macaques often harbored virus populations with a CD4-independent-HIGH and neutralization sensitive phenotype that changed to a CD4-independent-LOW and neutralization resistant virus population in the course of infection.

The expression of CXCR4 and LFA-1 on CD4(+) T lymphocytes didn\t change markedly during rhG-CSF mobilization, but the adhesive activity of CD4(+) T cells to ICAM-1 was frustrated after that.

CD4 changes over time were modeled using fold changes for CD4 absolute counts and differences for CD4 percentages.

Group 2 presented significantly higher CD8+ T cells infiltration than group 1, but no changes in CD4+ T cells (immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry).

In contrast, CTL responses were associated with a partial activation of neonatal CD11c(+) DC, reflected by the up-regulation of CD80 and CD86 expression but no concurrent changes in MHC class II or CD40 expression.

Potential MHC-I-restricted Aβ-derived epitopes were first analyzed for their capacity to recruit functional CD8(+) T cell responses in mouse models.

This effect was lost in CD8(-/-) and CCR2(-/-) mice and when mice were treated with β(2)-microglobulin-deficient GIFT-21 DCs, indicating that GIFT-21 DCs migrated to and sampled from the tumors to present tumor Ags to CCL2 recruited CD8(+) T cells via MHC class I.

Confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer flow cytometry demonstrate CD8 is recruited to the site of TCR:peptide MHC binding.

We show that natural infection induces dengue-specific CD8(+) T lymphocytes that are highly activated and proliferating, exhibit antiviral effector functions, and express CXCR3, CCR5, and the skin-homing marker cutaneous lymphocyte-associated antigen (CLA).

This work indicates that, in the host absence of CCR5, naive B-1 cells may activate CD8T lymphocytes thereby promoting tumor resistance.

Following hepatic expression of cognate HCV antigen using a previously described liver transfection method, we show that this pool of vaccine-induced HCV-specific CD8⁺ T cells retained its ability to become highly activated as shown by the upregulation of IFN-γ and CCR5 expression, as well as by the clearance of HCV NS3 expressing hepatocytes.

Leukocytosis was decreased in infected ccl3-/- mice, paralleling the accumulation of CD8+ T cells devoid of activated CCR5+ LFA-1+ cells in the spleen.

CCR5 was more prominently expressed on activated CD4(+) than CD8(+) T cells in the spleens of allograft wild-type recipients and on CD4(+) T cells infiltrating the cardiac allografts.

CCR5 chemokine ligands, released from activated CD8(+) T-cells, contribute to the antiviral activity of these cells.

Expression of CD69, TNF-R1, Fas, FasL, bcl-2, and bax was investigated in 41 MS patients and 12 healthy controls by flow cytometry in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR3.

By contrast, lymphoid aggregates in Crohn\s disease and lymphoid follicles in the normal intestinal mucosa were characterized by abundant B cells, a predominance of CD4+ T cells over CD8+ T cells, and low frequencies of cells expressing CCR5 or CXCR3.

CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR6 were expressed on intrahepatic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer (NK) T cells, NK cells, and B cells at significantly higher frequencies than on peripheral lymphocyte subsets.

In addition, CCR5 is expressed on 3-- 10 % of CD4 and 10-- 40 % of CD8-positive T cells and is weakly detectable on monocytes.

The CCR5 ligands RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta are HIV-1 suppressive factors secreted by CD8+ cells that inhibit NSI viruses.

Furthermore, the presence of CCL5 and CXCL10 in the cytolytic granules of tissue-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells expressing CCR5 and CXCR3 reveals a potential self-recruiting mechanism involving activated effector cytotoxic T cells.

The addition of IL-2 or IL-15, but not IL-7, significantly inhibited caspase activation, increased Bcl-2 expression, and rapidly initiated proliferation in vitro of CD8(+) T cells expressing CCR5 and multiple TCRBV subfamilies.

Because the chemokine receptor CCR5 is expressed on Th1 CD4(+) cells, it is important to investigate the expression and function of this receptor on other T cells involved in Th1 immune responses, such as Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells, which to date have been only partially characterized.

Multicolor flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that CCR5 is expressed on memory (CD28+CD45RA-) and effector (CD28-CD45RA- and CD28-CD45RA+) CD8+ T cells but not on naive (CD28+CD45RA+) CD8+ T cells.

Conversely, the expansion of CD8(+) T cells, and specifically those expressing the CCR5 chemokine receptor, above and beyond the levels observed in senescence, points to the involvement of adaptive immune pathways.

In a prospective study of 128 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with cryptococcal meningitis who received antifungal therapy followed by cART, we examined the proportions of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressing CCR5 and/or CXCR3, in CSF and whole blood and the concentrations of CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL3 in stored CSF and plasma.

The CCR5 antagonist, maraviroc (MVC), is associated with an enhanced CD4+ T-cell response independent of virological suppression.

Although both C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5)-and CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using HIV-1 strains cause AIDS, the emergence of CXCR4-utilizing variants is associated with an accelerated decline in CD4+ T cells.

In HIV-1-infected individuals, high percentages of CCR5-expressing cells were associated with low CD4+ T cell numbers (p = 0.001), high viral RNA load in serum (p = 0.046), and low T cell function (p = 0.054).

Conversely, broadening chemokine receptor usage from CCR5 to both CCR5 and CXCR4 was associated with infection by a virus having a syncytium-inducing phenotype and correlated with a faster rate of CD4 T-cell decline and progression of disease.

Furthermore, CD4(+) T-cells were activated with carbamazepine in a HLA-DRB1,04:04-restricted manner, indicating that a common HLA haplotype may contribute to the multiclonal T-cell response seen in European patients with CBZ hypersensitivity.

The CD8α(Neg) DC subset is specialized for MHC class II antigen presentation and is centrally involved in priming CD4 T cells.

In HIV-infected Hu-PBL mice, treatment with anti-CCR5 (viral coreceptor) and antiviral siRNAs complexed to scFvCD7-9R controlled viral replication and prevented the disease-associated CD4 T cell loss.

CD8 cell-mediated immune responses were detected by interferon-gamma ELISpot assay.

To address these disadvantages, we have used an interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) Elispot assay for detecting peptide-specific CD8(+) lymphocytes in PBMC.

A Mane-A,10/KP9 tetramer was then developed to quantify CD8(+) T lymphocytes primed by multigenic DNA vaccination, which have previously been difficult to detect using standard interferon-gamma-based T cell assays.

However, existing strategies utilizing RNA or long peptides for the neoantigen vaccines render limited immune responses since only 20-30 % of neoantigens predicted in silico to bind MHC I molecules are capable of eliciting immune responses with the majority of responding T cells are CD4+.

We found that in normal human skin IL-17-producing CD4+ TRM cells that responded to C albicans in an MHC class II-restricted fashion could be identified readily.

The frequencies of HLA-A,02 and-B,27 were significantly raised in recurrent patients, and ones of HLA-A,02,-A,03 and-B,27 similarly in patients without a positive family history.

These findings strongly imply that differences among HLA-DRB1,15 haplotypes will furnish the basis for MHC-associated susceptibility in MS and raise the possibility that the MHC haplotype is the fundamental unit of genetic control of immune response.

In order to better define the mechanisms of the HLA-B 2705 immune control of HIV, we first characterized the CD8(+) T-cell responses of nine highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)-naïve B 2705-positive subjects.

These data are consistent with previous studies indicating an important role for the B 2705-Gag KK10 response in the control of HIV but also suggest a previously unrecognized role played by the subdominant Pol-specific KY9 response in HLA-B 2705-mediated control of HIV and that the recognition of HIV-infected cells by CD8(+) T cells early in the viral life cycle may be important for viral containment in HIV-infected individuals.

Genome-wide association studies of this highly genetic disease have implicated specific immune pathways, including the interleukin (IL)-17/IL-23 pathway, control of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, amino acid trimming for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presentation, and other genes controlling CD8 and CD4 T cell subsets.

The association between particular major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) alleles and control of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) replication implies that certain CD8(+) T-lymphocyte (CD8-TL) responses are better able than others to control viral replication in vivo.

The presence of certain MHC class I alleles is correlated with remarkable control of HIV and SIV, indicating that specific CD8 T cell responses can effectively reduce viral replication.

Additional analysis of TCR on HLA-CW3 immune populations by flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction further indicates that the vast majority of responding CD8+ cells express restricted V alpha domains, a dominant J alpha segment (pHDS58), and a conserved CDR3 length for both alpha and beta chains.

Except PBMCs, Th2 and CD8+ T cells, the expression levels of the key enzymes involved in glycolysis and HIF-1α were significantly higher in B cells, DCs, Tregs, CD4+CD25-T cells, and Th1 and Th17 cells in MG patients, and the measurement of ECAR and OCR confirmed the metabolic status.

Specific CD8(+) T cells actively find infected hepatocytes and target intra-cellular parasites through mechanisms that are both interferon-γ-dependent and-independent.

Since IL-12 and interferon-γ are the major T helper (Th) 1 cytokines, increased expression of interferon regulatory factor 4, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-13 promoted the differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into Th2 cells.

MHC class I antigens (HLA-ABC and beta 2 microglobulin) were constitutively expressed but not significantly enhanced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma).

Proliferation of mature CD4+ T cells during lymphopenia (homeostatic proliferation) requires interaction with endogenous peptide MHC.

Antigen-specific T cell lines may be deleted by a signalling mechanism which involves molecules other than gp120/CD4 but still requires MHC class II restriction.

The observed HIV-1 replication enhancement conferred by ECs occurred only in memory CD4+ T cells required expression of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules by the ECs, and could not be conferred by fixed ECs, all of which are consistent with a requirement for EC-mediated T-cell activation via T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling.

First, the cytolytic activity by CD4+ T cells required high MHC class II expression on melanoma cells, which was not satisfied in a subset of melanomas.

IFN-γ produced mainly by CD4(+) T cells is required to upregulate MHCII expression by IECs.

The artificial in vitro activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes by a combination of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate and ionomycin, the so-called T/I model led to an inducible production of cytokines, such as interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-2.

We also discussed the controversial role of CD8 T cells in affecting the Th1/Th2 phenotype of responses to MHC and other antigens, and the potential role of their relative scarcity in neonates in biasing responses towards an antibody, Th2 mode.

The present study using chimeric H-2Kb molecules with recombinant alpha 3 domain between H-2Kb and HLA-B7 as well as single amino acid mutants of H-2Kb demonstrated that each substitution at residues 224 and 228 affects recognition of CD8-dependent mouse CTL clones.

Our data demonstrate that the naturally occurring sugar trehalose at doses safely achieved in humans inhibits HIV through two mechanisms: (i) decreased entry through the downregulation of CCR5 in T cells and decreased CD4 expression in both T cells and macrophages and (ii) degradation of intracellular HIV through the induction of MTOR-independent autophagy.

These findings indicate that expansion of the peripheral T-cell pool mediated the increase in CD4 counts and suggest that approaches to reconstitute CD4 helper cell activity and decrease CCR5 expression may augment natural immunity to HIV infection.

Furthermore, treatment of mice with a dual CCR1/CCR5 peptide antagonist, methionylated RANTES, also markedly reduced hepatic injury and decreased the numbers of CD4(+) T cells within the liver producing IFN-gamma during Con A-induced hepatitis.

Mice transplanted with these cells showed functional and persistent resistance to a CCR5-tropic HIV strain: viral load was significantly decreased over months, and human CD4(+) T cells were preserved.

In a previous study, we found that in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus macaques (RM), CD4(+) TSCM are preserved in number but show (i) a decrease in the frequency of CCR5(+) cells, (ii) an expansion of the fraction of proliferating Ki-67(+) cells, and (iii) high levels of SIV DNA.

The prevalence of CCR5-tropic HIV-1 phenotype declines with decreasing CD4 cell count and increasing viral load.

The total CD4+ T(EM)-cell pool underwent immune activation in controllers, as indicated by increased HLA-DR expression decreased IL-7Ralpha expression, a bias towards gamma interferon production upon polyclonal stimulation, and increased macrophage inflammatory protein 1 beta secretion associated with chronic CCR5 down-regulation.

Our results indicate a close relationship between HIV-1 phenotypic changes and the pathogenic process, since the mode and efficiency of CCR5 use as well as the decrease in the RANTES sensitivities of isolated viruses are significantly correlated with CD4(+)-T-cell decline in a patient.

Here, we determined by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching that the lateral diffusion of CD4 decreased 4-fold following sphingomyelinase treatment, while the effective diffusion rate of CCR5 remained unchanged.

Likely, the inflammatory response to HZ pathology provoked local HIV-1 production by enhanced trafficking or activation of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes.

The binding of HIV-1 Envelope glycoproteins (Env) to host receptor CD4 exposes vulnerable conserved epitopes within the co-receptor binding site (CoRBS) which are required for the engagement of either CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor to allow HIV-1 entry.

Consistent with this, pretreatment of gp120 with CV-N inhibited soluble CD4 (sCD4)-dependent binding of gp120 to cell-associated CCR5.

To investigate possible effects of CV-N at post-CD4 binding steps, we used an assay that measures sCD4 activation of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein for fusion with CCR5-expressing cells.

We have previously shown that FLSC, a chimeric protein containing HIV-1BAL gp120 and the D1 and D2 domains of human CD4, blocks the binding and entry of HIV-1 into target cells by occluding CCR5, the major HIV-1 coreceptor.

All Envs bound to CD4 binding site, membrane-proximal, and V1/V2 MAbs with similar apparent affinities, although the T/F Envs bound with higher affinity to the MAb 17 b, a CCR5 coreceptor binding site antibody.

The present study demonstrates that HR212 does not block gp120-CD4 binding or interfere with binding to the coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5.

HIV-1 targets human cells expressing both the CD4 receptor, which binds the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120, as well as either the CCR5 (R5) or CXCR4 (X4) co-receptors, which interact primarily with the third hypervariable loop (V3 loop) of gp120.

Structural studies revealed potential alterations within the gp120 V3 loop, the gp41 interaction sites at the gp120 C- and N-termini, and within the gp120 CD4 binding site which may directly or indirectly lead to more efficient CCR5-usage.

Interaction of gp120 with the primary receptor, CD4, results in the exposure of the gp120 third variable (V3) loop, which contributes to binding the CCR5 or CXCR4 chemokine receptors.

The adapted virus, termed TA1, retained the V3 truncation, was exquisitely sensitive to neutralization by the CD4 binding site monoclonal antibody b12 and by HIV-positive human sera, used CCR5 to enter cells, and was completely resistant to small molecule CCR5 antagonists.

A similar treatment of the HIV-1 gp120 yielded a number of fragments that are associated with the critical CD4 binding site, or the partially buried CCR5 binding site of the protein.

Recombinant gp120 proteins from isolates of HIV-1 subtypes B and C were expressed, purified, and assessed in a CD4 binding assay and a CCR5 chemokine competition binding assay.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) interaction with the primary receptor, CD4, induces conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoproteins that allow binding to the CCR5 second receptor and virus entry into the host cell.

The interaction of LRTV-1 with gp120 was enhanced upon CD4 binding and sequence comparison revealed homology between LRTV-1 and the second extracellular loop of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) (11/23) and the N-terminus of C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) (7/23).

This peptide recognizes a CD4-dependent gp120 epitope critical for coreceptor binding and mimics the surface of CXCR4 and CCR5.

We have previously shown that FLSC, a fusion protein containing gp120(BAL) and the D1 and D2 domains of human CD4, specifically binds CCR5, an important cellular co-receptor, and inhibits the entry of R5 HIV isolates.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) enters host cells through the binding of its envelope glycoproteins (Env) to the host cell receptor CD4 and then subsequent binding to a chemokine coreceptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4.

An HIV-1 infection in a host cell occurs through an ordered process that involves HIV-1 attachment to the host\s cellular CD4 receptor, co-receptor binding to CCR5 or CXCR4, and the subsequent fusion with the cellular membrane.

D197 and T/V200 increased fusion and infection of cells expressing low CD4 by enhancing gp120 binding to CCR5.

Binding of HP-HSA to CD4 or gp120 was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and flow cytometry, while binding of HP-HSA to the coreceptor CXCR4 or CCR5 was detected by cell-based ELISA.

gp120 interacts with the CD4 receptor of the host cell and subsequently V3 binds either CCR5 or CXCR4.

Viral tropism for HIV includes CD4+ cells, macrophages, and microglial cells, and it is through binding with co-receptors C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4).

We further show that, unlike soluble forms of CD4, CD4bs antibodies poorly induce envelope glycoprotein conformations that efficiently bind CCR5.

Interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope glycoprotein with the primary receptor, CD4 promotes binding to a chemokine receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4.

Interaction of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 envelope glycoprotein with the primary receptor, CD4, promotes binding to a chemokine receptor, either CCR5 or CXCR4.

We also used the biosensor to demonstrate CD4-dependent binding of gp120 to solubilized CCR5 and to develop affinity chromatography-based purification methods that increased receptor activity more than 300 %.

In addition to the CD4 molecule that binds to the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120, productive HIV-1 infection requires interaction with cellular receptors for alpha- or beta- chemokines (CXCR4 and CCR5 respectively).

Upon binding the host cell receptor, CD4, gp120 assumes a conformation that is able to bind the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4, which act as coreceptors for the virus.

In addition to CD4, different gp120 isolates bind to the alpha- or beta-chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively.

CD4 is the principal binding site for human and simian immunodeficiency virus (HIV/SIV) receptor interactions and the a chemokine receptor CXCR4 has been implicated as a primordial lentivirus receptor.

We show here that gp120 proteins from two CD4-independent HIV-2 Env\s, VCP and ROD/B bind directly to CXCR4 with an apparently high affinity.

However, mutations in CXCR4 that markedly reduced binding did not necessarily hinder cell-cell fusion by VCP or ROD/B, especially in the presence of CD4.

The activation of this signaling pathway requires functional CD4 receptors and is independent of binding to CXCR4.

In addition, we show that the envelop glycoprotein from the T-cell-tropic human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) strain IIIB is a CD4-independent, dose-dependent inhibitor of the binding of stromal cell-derived factor 1 to its receptor, CXCR4.

Further mechanism studies confirmed that ADS-J1 does not block gp120-CD4 binding and exhibits a marginal interaction with the HIV-1 coreceptor CXCR4.

While dC13 did not block binding of gp120 to CD4, nor disrupt the gp41 six-helix bundle formation, it effectively blocked the binding of an anti-CXCR4 monoclonal antibody and chemokine SDF-1alpha to CXCR4-expressing cells.

Further mechanistic analysis revealed that (-) G-Ala neither blocks gp120-CD4 binding nor interacts with the HIV-1 co-receptor CXCR4.

CD4(+) invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are required for liver damage in some mouse models of hepatitis, while the chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CCR5 are considered dominant Th1 chemokine receptors involved in Th1 trafficking in inflammatory conditions.

Microcalorimetric titrations demonstrate that measurable binding of S22 peptide, a 22-amino acid tyrosine-sulfated peptide corresponding to the CCR5 N-terminus requires prior binding of CD4 to gp120.

The most abundant form of HIV-1 uses CCR5 as the coreceptor and requires a high density of CD4 for efficient entry, defining its target cell as the CD4+ memory T cell.

The receptor binding assays confirmed that the produced glycoproteins are competent for binding CD4 and undergo proper CD4-induced conformational changes required for interaction with CCR5.

These results demonstrate that HIV-1 virions induce apoptosis through a CXCR4- or CCR5-dependent pathway that does not require Env/CD4 signaling or membrane fusion and suggest that HIV-1 variants with increased envelope/receptor affinity or coreceptor binding site exposure may promote T-cell depletion in vivo by accelerating bystander cell death.

Collectively, these results indicate that CCR5 expression is required for the regulatory functions of Tregs that restrict alloreactive CD4 T-cell responses to single class II MHC-mismatched cardiac allografts.

Interestingly, similar to the CCR5 homodimer, the CXCR4-CCR5 heterodimer relied on Rabs1 and 11 but also required Rab2 when CD4 was absent, and only Rab 1 when CD4 was present.

HIV entry into CD4(+) cells requires interaction with a cellular receptor, generally either CCR5 or CXCR4.

We found that the transmitted viruses all used CCR5 and required high levels of CD4 to infect target cells, suggesting selection for replication in T cells and not macrophages after transmission.

Furthermore, we identified two kinases regulated by CCR5-HIV signaling-p70-S6K1 (RPS6KB1) and MK2 (MAPKAPK2)-that were also required for optimal HIV infection of CD4+ T cells.

Along with CD4, HIV-1 requires a chemokine receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4, as an entry co-receptor, and differential co-receptor selectivity is an important determinant of viral diversity and pathogenesis.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) entry into CD4(+) cells requires the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 as co-fusion receptors.

The chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) of the immune system and the major co-receptors required for entry of HIV into CD4(+) target cells.

Bystander apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells required direct contact with virions and Env/CXCR4 binding.

After CD3/CD28 activation, IFN-β(-/-) CD4+ T cells express higher levels of IRF-4 required for Th17 differentiation, and increased expression of CCR6, IL-23R, IL-6R, and CXCR4, compared with activated IFN-β(+/+) T cells.

Viral envelope glycoproteins interaction with CD4 controls cell activation and proliferation required for virus production whereas interaction with CXCR4 favors apoptosis thereby decreasing the host immune response.

Thus, a CD4-associated signaling molecule(s) including p56lck is activated by gp120 and is required for the down-regulation of CXCR4.

However, a Ser/IleLeu motif, similar to that required for the endocytosis of CD4 and the T cell receptor/CD3 complex is required for phorbol ester-induced, but not ligand-induced, CXCR4 endocytosis.

HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T cells respond to HIV antigens presented by HIV-1-infected DCs and in this process become infected, thereby providing a mechanism through which HIV-1-specific CD4(+) T cells could become preferentially infected in vivo.

Thus, although profound depletion of tissue CD4+ memory T cells appeared to be a prerequisite for early pathogenesis, it was the inability to respond to this depletion with sustained production of tissue-homing CD4+ memory T cells that best distinguished rapid progressors, suggesting that mechanisms of the CD4+ memory T cell generation play a crucial role in maintaining immune homeostasis in stable SIV infection.

Few with a baseline CD4 count ≥\240\200 cells/µL experienced a drop below 200 cells/µL suggesting limited utility for ongoing CD4 monitoring.

BMS-529 complexed gp150 trimers in detergent micelles, which were isolated from CHO cells, bound to bnAbs, including UCA and intermediates of the CD4 binding-site (bs) CH103 bnAb lineage, showed limited exposure of CD4i epitopes and a glycosylation pattern with a preponderance of high-mannose glycans.

By contrast, the additional constraint of obligatory CD4 binding, just prior to CKR engagement, radically restricts potential host cells within an individual (or lymph node microenvironment), and might also limit xenotransmission, as CD4 sequences vary among primates.

The two CD4-independent strains of SIV tested developed nearly complete CD4 dependence over several months of serial passage in hPBMCs, correlating with a limited number of non-synonymous env region mutations, some previously reported to be determinants of CD4-dependency.

Furthermore, using dual-protein ligands and the antigenic memory of some sub-populations of NK cells would also allow the creation of defacto vaccines based on a host\s NK cells, instead of vaccines utilizing CD4 and CD8 α:β T cells, which are limited by the requirement of MHC presentation of the target antigens to α:β T cells.

The presence of viral genes that down-regulate MHC class II molecules and the expression of viral IL-10 both limit antigen presentation to CD4+ T cells, underlining the important role that this T cell subset has in antiviral immunity.

To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying early host responses to HIV in the CD4(+) T cell target population, we examined gene expression in CD4(+) T cells isolated 24 h after ex vivo HIV infection of lymphocyte aggregate cultures derived from human tonsils.

The ability of KS2 Nef to down-regulate CD4 was more prominent when CD4 was measured 2-3 days after transfer of the nef gene to the target cells, and also when the effect was measured in CD4(+)-enriched primary T cells.

Because the env protein associates tightly with CD4 shortly after synthesis, we first targeted the env protein using a chimeric CD4 protein consisting of the extracellular domain of CD4 and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of LAMP-1.

Thus, although transmembrane and secreted TNF-alpha produced by HIV-1-specific CD4+ CTL may have important effects in vivo, the rapid destruction of target APC by the set of CD4+ CTL clones described here occurs through a TNF-alpha-independent mechanism.

As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infects the human body through the combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the gastrointestinal tract, the mechanism underlying the gastrointestinal symptoms may involve damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier and promotion of the production of inflammatory factors.

Locally, CD4+ T cells promote the recruitment and effector function of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and activate innate killer cells in the tumor.

Interference with this actively guided recruitment markedly reduces the ability of CD4+ T cells to promote memory CD8+ T-cell generation, indicating that an orchestrated series of differentiation events drives nonrandom cell-cell interactions within lymph nodes, optimizing CD8+ T-cell immune responses involving the few antigen-specific precursors present in the naive repertoire.

An agonist CD40 antibody based immunotherapy was less efficient at promoting tumor regression in elderly mice, which may be due to: (i) failure of elderly CD8+ T cells to up-regulate perforin, and (ii) increased expression of multiple regulatory markers on CD11c+ cells and T cells in elderly tumor-draining lymph nodes (including CD73, PD-1, ICOS, LAG-3, and TGF-β).

sT treatment also increased the percentage of CD8+ T lymphocytes promoted the generation of CD4+ T memory cells, reduced regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs), and reduced bone marrow-derived suppressor cells.

This was not due to these subsets contributing a higher proportion of the CD4+ T cell pool, rather these subsets were more susceptible to infection (median: 5.38 % EM and 2.15 % TM cells infected), consistent with heightened CCR5 expression on EM and TM cells.

By contrast, because CD4+ T cells can be infected by HIV-1 and at least some subsets secrete anti-viral CCR5 ligands, it is possible that these ligands protect against HIV-1 via autocrine as well as paracrine pathways.

Furthermore, when hNOJ (IR+) and hNOJ (IR-) mice, which were selected as naïve- and memory CD4(+) T cell subset-rich groups, respectively, were infected with CCR5-tropic HIV-1 in vivo, virus replication (as assessed by the plasma viral load) was delayed.

The coreceptor usage of 18 isolates was investigated by infecting U87 cells transfected with CD4 and chemokine receptors, and we found that 11 isolates infected only CCR5+ cells, 3 only CXCR4+ cells, whereas 4 used both coreceptors.

In particular, the CXCR4 (LESTR/fusin) receptor allows fusion and entry of T-tropic strains of HIV, whereas CCR5 is the major coreceptor used by primary HIV-1 strains that infect macrophages and CD4(+) T-helper cells (M-tropic viruses).

To explore this paradox, we stimulated CD45RA+ CD4(+) (naïve) and CD45RO+ CD4(+) (memory) cells with antibodies to CD3 and CD28 and infected them with either CCR5-dependent (R5) or CXCR4-dependent (X4) HIV-1 isolates.

We also found intense inflammation in the ileum of CCR5(-/-) infected mice, with epithelial ulceration, augmented CD4 and decreased frequency of NK cells in the gut lamina propria.

The tropism switch involves switching from using CCR5 to CXCR4 and corresponds to an expansion of infected cells to include naïve CD4(+) T cells.

Here we address whether CCR5 or CXCR4 tropism of the predominant viral strain detected before or on combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) explains why some human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients who begin ART with advanced HIV disease retain low interferon (IFN)-gamma responses, despite recovery of CD4(+) T cell counts.

Additionally, we developed a high-throughput antiviral assay using SARS-CoV-2-Nluc infection of A549 cells expressing human ACE2 receptor (A549-hACE2).

ACE2 is expressed in pancreatic islets, vascular endothelium, and adipose tissue, and the SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction in these tissues, along with other factors, governs the spectrum and the severity of clinical manifestations among COVID-19 patients with metabolic syndrome.

Since ACE2 is expressed in various tissues, such as brain, gut, heart, kidney, and lung, and since these organs represent obvious targets for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, therapeutic approaches were developed to either inhibit ACE2 or reduce its expression as a means of prevention of the virus entry into the corresponding host cells.

Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in 293 cells expressing ACE2.

The inhibition of R5 HIV-1 was postulated to result from the novel ability of the A120 mAb to induce the levels of the CCR5-binding β-chemokines MIP-1α, MIP-1β and/or RANTES, and the down modulation of CCR5 expression on activated CD4+ T cells.

Thus, OX40 stimulation enhanced the production of these CCR5-binding β-chemokines by the activated PBMCs and subsequently down-modulated CCR5 expression on the activated CD4(+) T cells.

Th17 and Th1 cells from both the blood and foreskin expressed higher levels of CCR5 and were more activated than other CD4 T cell subsets.

Recent studies have shown that CCR5 conformational heterogeneity influences chemokine-CCR5 interactions and HIV-1 entry in transfected cells or activated CD4(+) T lymphocytes.

The interaction between HIV-1 envelope (env) protein and target cell surface CD4 first activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway, and the subsequent interaction between HIV-1 env glycoprotein and CCR5/CXCR4 coreceptors establishes viral fusion and entry.

These results suggest that increased expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 on an activated CD4+ T-cell population coupled with persistently elevated chemokines may provide a suitable condition for continuous replication of HIV associated with TB coinfection.

Day 8 posttransplant serum titers of donor-specific Ab were 15-to 25-fold higher in CCR5(-/-) allograft recipients, and transfer of this serum provoked cardiac allograft rejection in RAG-1(-/-) recipients within 14 days, whereas transfer of either serum from wild-type recipients or immune serum from CCR5-deficient recipients diluted to titers observed in wild-type recipients did not mediate this rejection.

We further demonstrate that ERK1 is localized mainly in the cytoplasmic compartment and that it interacts directly with the CCR5 protein, thus provoking possible CCR5 degradation with a subsequent de novo synthesis, and that re-expression of CCR5 on the cell membrane required several days.

HIV-1 infection requires the presence of the CD4 receptor on the target cell surface and a coreceptor, predominantly CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5).

Reduced expression of CCR5 on target CD4(+) cells lowers their susceptibility to infection by R5-tropic HIV-1, potentially preventing transmission of infection and delaying disease progression.

CD8(+) Treg clones expressed CD3 and a variety of TCR V(β) chains as well as CD56, CD69, CD62L and CD95 but did not express CD16, CD161, CXCR4 and CCR7.

Here, we propose mathematical models that address the interdependence of the concentrations of CD4 and CCR5 for efficient infection by M-tropic HIV-1 as well as additional complications originated by coreceptor competition caused by posttranslational modifications that positively or negatively affect the coreceptor ability to form complexes with CD4 and/or HIV-1 envelope.

Depletion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells did not affect the immunosuppression of MSCs on CD4(+) T cells.

Unexpectedly, treatment of PBL blasts with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or a sulfhydryl oxidative reagent, diamide, almost completely inhibited PMA-induced CD4 down-regulation, although these oxidants per se did not affect the level of CD4 expression.

Although it was previously reported that the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 affect trafficking of respiratory virus-specific CD8+ T cells, it is unclear whether these receptors govern effector CD4+ T cell migration to the lungs.

Upregulated CCR5 and CCR3 expression could also be detected on a fraction of CD45RA+ T cells.

In addition, a significant decrease in C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) expression was detected on CD4 T cells, which was strongly correlated with the suppression of immune activation.

In phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated CD8-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with HIV-1 green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter viruses, DR(-) 38 (+) T cells constituted the majority of CCR5 (R5)-tropic (median, 62 %) and CXCR4 (X4)-tropic HIV-1-producing cells (median, 61 %), although cell surface CCR5 and CXCR4 were not elevated in this subset of cells.

SJL genetic content affected enhancer elements, gene regulation, protein expression, and amino acid content in CD4+ T helper 1 cells, and mice infected with influenza showed reduced expression of Cxcr4 on B6.

CXCR4-utilizing (X4) viruses preferentially, but not universally infect CD4+ T cells, generating high levels of virus within activated HIV-1-infected T cells that can be detected in regional lymph nodes and peripheral blood.

When the CD4 positive T cell line, PM1, was dually infected by both reporter viruses with different coreceptor utilization, coinfection with CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 (X4 HIV-1) expressing one reporter increased the rate of cells infected with HIV-1 expressing another reporter.

When primary activated CD4(+) T cells acutely infected with HIV-1(NL4-3) (CXCR4-using T-cell-line-tropic) were cocultured with PFA-fixed gp34(+) human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-bearing MT-2 cells or SV-T2/gp34 cells, HIV-1 production was also markedly enhanced.

This suggested that SI, CXCR4-tropic viruses may be able to infect quiescent CD4+ T cells.

Antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells infected with a T-tropic HIV-1 strain showed significantly higher CXCR4 and HIV-1 expression in Th0/2-oriented responses in comparison with Th1-oriented responses.

Similarly, in naive CD4+ T cells activated in the presence of IL-4 or IL-12 and infected with the same T-tropic strain, IL-4 up-regulated whereas IL-12 down-regulated both CXCR4 and HIV-1 expression.

CXCR4, a G-protein-coupled receptor, which binds the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1alpha, CXCL12), is one of two co-receptors most frequently used by HIV-1 to infect CD4+ lymphocytes.

In the present study, we describe the effects of an antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxyribonucleotide (anti-S-ODN) on the inhibition of CXCR4 gene expression in X4 HIV-1 infected HeLa-CD4 cells, to find more efficacious therapeutic possibilities for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection.

A gradual evolution to CXCR4 chemokine receptor use causes a shift in the proportion of productively infected cells to the CD4 cell population.

Transfection of L-selectin was sufficient for K562 cells to acquire sulfatide-induced CXCR4 up-regulation, while analysis of L-selectin knockout mice revealed that this response was critically L-selectin dependent only for CD4(+) T cells, suggesting an alternative pathway in CD8(+) T cells and B cells.

Experiments with granulocyte-specific CXCL12 conditionally depleted mice and a CXCR4 antagonist revealed that CXCL12 derived from neutrophil trails is critical for virus-specific CD8(+) T cell recruitment and effector functions.

Lung lymphocytes in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and emphysema secrete more interferon gamma--often associated with T helper 1 cells--and interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon, both of which bind to CXCR3 and are involved in attracting T helper 1 cells.

In response to interferon-inducible protein 10 and monokine induced by interferon, but not interferon gamma, lung macrophages secreted macrophage metalloelastase (matrix metalloproteinase-12), a potent elastin-degrading enzyme that causes tissue destruction and which has been linked to emphysema.

Interferon cascade induces the expression of interferon-stimulated genes then subsequently promotes antiviral immune responses.

Type 1 helper T-cell cytokine (interferon-gamma) and chemokine (interferon-gamma-inducible protein-10, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and regulated on activation, normal T cells expressed and secreted) messenger RNA up-regulation was detected (real-time polymerase chain reaction) by postoperative day 3 in small-bowel allografts.

The plausible mechanisms of pinosylvin on the suppression of iNOS gene expression were found to be associated with the downregulation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and interferon-β (IFN-β) expression, which are related to Toll/IL-1 receptor domain-containing adapter inducing interferon-β (TRIF)-mediated signaling.

The expression of CXCR4 was down modulated in CD8+ lymphocytes after infection with the 93 US143-T8 isolate.

Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein to CD4 triggers conformational changes in gp120 that promote its interaction with one of the chemokine receptors, usually CCR5, ultimately leading to gp41-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion and entry.

IL-12, but not IL-4, IL-10, or IL-13, now has been shown to down-modulate the surface expression of CCR5 induced by IL-2 on both CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes.

Expression of CCR5 and related receptors CCR1 and CCR3 on CD4- and CD8-positive T-cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CSF was determined by flow cytometry in 20 patients with ON, 16 control patients with lumbar spondylosis, 20 healthy controls (HC) and 16 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

We targeted the SIV CCR5 coreceptor in a combined CCR5-SIV antigen immunization strategy.

Noninfectious CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 virions, but not microvesicles, partially activated freshly isolated CD4(+) and CD8(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cell T lymphocytes to express FasL and Fas, but not CD69 or CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha) and eventually die via apoptosis starting 4 to 6 days postexposure.

Transmission of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4)-dependent (X4) and R5 HIV-1 from MDM to IL-2 activated CD4 T cells was also investigated.

) increasing numbers of CXCR4-expressing activated naive CD4+ T cells with declining total CD4+ T cell counts, thereby providing increased numbers of activated target cells for productive infection by X4 virus.

This has been exemplified recently in our findings that HIV-1 employs envelope-CXCR4 interaction to activate a cellular actin depolymerization factor, cofilin, to support viral latent infection of resting CD4 T cells.

The up-regulation of CCR5 was more extensive than that of CCR6, as only approximately half the activated CCR5+ T cells coexpressed CCR6.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) interaction with the primary receptor, CD4 induces conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoproteins that allow binding to the CCR5 second receptor and virus entry into the host cell.

In contrast to primary CD4+ T cells, HD5 did not induce cytotoxicity and promote HIV infectivity of HeLa-CD4-CCR5 cells under serum-deprived conditions.

CD40 stimulation induced secretion of CCR5 ligands in endothelial cells, enhanced with IFN-γ.

These results demonstrate that CCR5-tropic HIV induces significant reprogramming of host CD4+ T cell protein production pathways and identifies two novel kinases induced upon viral binding to the cell surface that are critical for HIV replication in host cells.

Using saturation transfer difference NMR, we determined the region of CCR5 ECL2 used for binding gp120, showed that it can bind to gp120 from both R5 and X4 isolates, and demonstrated that the peptide interacts with a CD4-gp120 complex in a similar manner as to gp120 alone.

M9 competed with a sulfated CCR5 N-terminal peptide for binding to gp120-CD4 complex, suggesting an overlapping epitope with the coreceptor binding site.

Microcalorimetric titrations demonstrate that measurable binding of S22 peptide, a 22-amino acid tyrosine-sulfated peptide corresponding to the CCR5 N-terminus, requires prior binding of CD4 to gp120.

As peptides containing sulfo-tyrosines are difficult to synthesize and handle due to limited stability of the sulfo-ester moiety, we have now incorporated TYS isosteres into CCR5 Nt analogs and assessed their binding to a complex of gp120-CD4 using saturation transfer difference (STD) NMR and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).

An alanine insertion within the GPG motif (G310_P311insA) of the MVC-resistant gp120 V3 loop is responsible for the decreased CCR5 binding affinity, while impaired binding to CD4 is due to sequence changes outside V3.

Comparison of the ternary arrangement of the loops in this model with those bound to PGT122 and PGV04 suggested a possible motion of\240\the V1V2 away from the CCR5 binding site and\240\toward CD4.

Thus, although similar regions of X4 and R5 HIV-1 gp120s appear to be involved in binding CXCR4 and CCR5, respectively, differences exist in nonspecific binding to cell surfaces, affinity for the chemokine receptor, and CD4 dependence at low temperature.

In cells lacking human CXCR4 expression, this gp120-mediated inhibition of ADA binding to human CD26 was completely dependent on the expression of human CD4.

The HIV-1 gp120 exterior envelope glycoprotein bound tightly to proteoliposomes expressing only CD4 and, in the presence of soluble CD4 bound weakly to proteoliposomes expressing only CXCR4.

However, neither SDF-la that binds CXCR4 nor recombinant gp120 (rgp120) that binds CD4 could specifically inhibit the observed enhancement of MVV-induced cell fusion under conditions that significantly reduced HIV-1-induced cell fusion.

In stringent support of these data, CD4 colocalized with patches of cholera toxin bound to the raft-associated sphingoglycolipid GM1, whereas CXCR4 did not.

Moreover, these findings suggest multiple and potentially synergistic mechanisms at the basis of the resistance of CD34(+) cells to X4 HIV infection, including their ability to produce SDF-1, and the lack of CXCR4 internalization following gp120 binding to CD4.

Amino acid residues critical for CXCR4 are not critical for interactions with the primary binding receptor CD134, which has an equivalent role as CD4 for HIV-1 binding.

In addition to induction by bm12 renal allografts, the I-A(bm12) β-chain-reactive CD8 T cells were induced in CCR5-deficient, but not wild-type C57BL/6, mice by immunization with the peptides.

Infection with a pathogenic CCR5 (R5)-specific enveloped virus, SHIVSF162P, was compared with infection with the CXCR4 (X4)-specific SHIVSF33A.

These results suggest that immunization in macaques induces CD8-SF and beta-chemokines which may prevent SIV infection by blocking the CCR5 coreceptors both in circulating cells and in the rectal and genital draining lymph node cells.

The human chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 have emerged as the predominant cofactors, along with CD4, for cellular entry of HIV-1 in vivo whereas the contribution of other chemokine receptors to HIV disease has not been yet determined.

CCR5-dependent (R5) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates predominate in the early, asymptomatic stages of HIV-1 infection, while CXCR4-dependent (X4) isolates typically emerge at later stages, frequently coinciding with a rapid decline in CD4 T cells.

Suppression of SIV replication by unstimulated CD8(+) T cells required direct contact and was major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted.

Although a role for CD8(+) T cells has not been excluded, they are not required in the HLA-B27 transgenic rat model, and do not dominate at sites of disease in humans.

Abacavir adverse reactions were recently shown to be driven by drug-specific activation of cytokine-producing, cytotoxic CD8(+) T cells that required HLA-B,57:01 molecules for their function.

This ability is not restricted to protective HLA-B haplotypes, does not require proliferation or the addition of exogenous factors, is not restored by HAART, and primarily originates from effector CD8(+) T-cells with otherwise limited functional capability.

The interaction with AP-1 required for CD28 and CD8β differed from the AP-1 interaction required for MHC-I downmodulation in that it was mediated through the dileucine motif within Nef (LL(164165) AA) and did not require the tyrosine binding pocket of the AP-1 μ subunit.

Specific CD8(+) CTL recognition of melanoma requires expression of MHC class I molecules as well as melanoma-associated peptide epitopes.

CD8(+) T lymphocytes, which are major immune effectors require primary stimulation by dendritic cells (DC) presenting MHC class I molecule-bound epitopes.

Immune surveillance of infected or tumor cells by CD8+ T cells requires that MHC class I molecules present a diverse repertoire of peptides on the cell surface.

Thus, CD8 T cell bystander activation, although independent of cognate Ag, still requires self-pMHC and TCR signaling.

Differentiation of CD8(+) CD28(low) Treg cells requires MHC class I expression on radioresistant but not on haematopoietic thymic stromal cells.

The activation of CD8(+) T-cells requires the uptake of exogenous polypeptide antigens and proteolytic processing of these antigens to octamer or nonamer peptides, which are loaded on MHC-I complexes and presented to the T-cell.

We further demonstrate that robust CD8(+) T-cell priming can occur through the cross-presentation pathway but requires the presence of either a strong MHC class II epitope or antibodies to the transgene product.

Although HL may be a situation in which defective immune surveillance is restored by anti-PD1 therapy, it challenges our current explanation of how anti-PD1 agents work because MHC-I expression is required for CD8-T-cell-mediated tumour antigen recognition.

Vaccines designed to bring forth CD8+ T cell responses in different racial and ethnic groups will require inclusion of T cell epitopes presented by various MHC class I molecules.

Therefore, we conclude that full CD8 memory differentiation requires only a single MHC class Ia chain, ruling out a requirement for MHC class Ib molecules in this process.

Supernatants from stimulated CD8(+) T cells were also able to inhibit replication of both CCR5- and CXCR4-dependent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains.

These CC-chemokines, however, do not account for all CD8(+) T-cell antiviral factor(s) (CAF) released from these cells, particularly because the elusive CAF can inhibit the replication of X4 HIV-1 strains that use CXCR4 and not CCR5 as a coreceptor.

Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 potently inhibited skin inflammation in both models, associated with reduced inflammatory angiogenesis and inflammatory cell accumulation, including dermal CD4+ cells and intraepidermal CD8+ T cells.

Suppressive activity of MDSCs on CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cell proliferation is significantly inhibited by anti-CCR5 antibody.

Ligation of CCR5 by the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha or MIP-1beta, and of CXCR4 by the CXC chemokine SDF-1alpha, profoundly inhibits the replication of HIV strains that use these coreceptors for entry into CD4(+) T lymphocytes.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a gene transfer lentiviral vector expressing a combination of viral entry inhibitors, the C46 peptide (an inhibitor of viral fusion) and the P2-CCL5 intrakine (a modulator of CCR5 expression), to prevent CD4⁺ T-cell infection in vivo.

CCR5 inhibitors represent a new class of antiretroviral agents that block the CCR5 receptor and prevent HIV-1 recognition and entry into CD4+ macrophages and T-cells.

CCR5 inhibitors are a novel class of antiretroviral agents that block the CCR5 receptor, thereby preventing HIV-1 recognition and entry into CD4+ macrophages and T-cells.

CXCR4 antagonism also reduced the abundance of splenic CD4+ T cells.

Our results indicate that activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes reduces surface expression of CXCR4 in part by receptor internalization and that cell activation-dependent CXCR4 down-regulation limits spread of infection by X4 viruses.

Interfering with the action of CXCR3 and CXCR4 with these synthetic receptor antagonists inhibited experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of multiple sclerosis and reduced the accumulation of CD4(+) T cells in the CNS.

Unexpectedly, GC T cells were virtually nonresponsive to CXCL12, whereas CD57(-) CD4 T cells migrated efficiently despite reduced CXCR4 expression.

Herein, whereas the treatment of CXCR4-luc-B16 cells in vitro with the CXCR4 ligand CXCL12 did not reduce killing induced by cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, CXCL12 markedly reduced Fas-dependent killing by gp100-specific (pmel-1) CD8(+) T cells.

Although virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from CCL3(-/-) mice were CD44(high), they remained CD62L(high) and CD25(low)  retained CCR7 expression, and contained limited transcripts of the proinflammatory chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 compared with virus-specific CD8(+) T cells from CCL3(+/+) mice.

CD4-BFFI also retained antiviral potency against virus strains resistant to two fusion inhibitors, a CCR5 antagonist and an anti-CCR5 mAb.

Con A-activated macaque CD4-enriched PBMCs retained 88 % of CXCR4 and 39 % of CCR5 expression over 17 days compared with PHA-activated cells (50 % for CXCR4, 16 % for CCR5) and anti-CD3/CD28-activated cells (34 % for CXCR4, 37 % for CCR5).

The qualitative superiority of CD8+ T cells retained in hemizygous mice was also seen during influenza A virus infection, in which epitope-specific CD8+ T cells from hemizygous mice had a higher avidity for pMHCI and increased cytokine polyfunctionality, despite a reduced response magnitude.

Macrophage tropism has been linked to the ability to enter cells through CCR5 in conjunction with limiting CD4 levels, which are much lower on macrophages than on T cells.

Titration experiments showed that CXCR6 and CCR5 were more efficient than other coreceptors when tested at limiting CD4/coreceptor levels.

Besides CD4, which is the major receptor for HIV-1 and SIV, a number of chemokine receptors including but not limited to APJ, CCR3, CXCR4, and CCR5 may be coreceptors for HIV-1/SIV, not only in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues but also in the central nervous system (CNS).

These findings indicated that Tax-specific CD8+ T-cells were scarce and dysfunctional not only in ATL patients but also in a limited AC population, and that the dysfunction was selective for HTLV-1-specifc CD8+ T-cells in early stages.

These results suggest that top CD8 clones are selected in stochastic fashion in each animal but limit further diversification, and that brain-infiltrating CD8 cells in TLR7tg mice are not selected by a common tissue Ag.

We showed that NP with increased degradation rates improved CD8+ T cell activation in vitro if the amount of antigen was limited or if CD8+ T cells were of low functional avidity.

Moreover, in vitro experiments indicated that TNF triggered activated CD8(+) T cell death in a TNF-R1-dependent manner, likely limiting the accumulation of tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells in TNF/TNF-R1-proficient animals.

While three of five participants exhibited some degree of proviral compartmentalization between CD4+ T cell subsets combined analyses revealed no evidence that any particular CD4+ T cell subset harbored the longest persisting, most genetically diverse, and/or most genetically distinctive HIV reservoir.

Blocking NKG2A on CD8+ cells and NK cells in cancers modulated tumor growth, restoring CD8+ T and NK cell function.

These findings suggest that TCR signal strength and Ag affinity independently contribute to CD8+ memory T cell development, which is modulated by inflammation, and suggest that manipulating TCR signal strength along with Ag affinity, may be used to tune the development of CD8+ memory T cells during vaccine development.

We demonstrated that this T cell population produces higher levels of interferon-γ and granzyme B ex vivo and that HGF directly restrains the cytolytic function of c-Met+CD8+ T cells in cell-mediated cytotoxicity reactions CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our findings suggest that the HGF/c-Met pathway could be exploited to modulate CD8+ T cell-mediated neuroinflammation.

The CD8(+) cells treated with concanavalin A had increased CCR4 mRNA at 72 h, increased CCR6 mRNA at 24 h, and decreased CCR8 and CXCR4 mRNA at 24 h of stimulation.

The CD8(+) cells treated with concanavalin A had increased CCR4 mRNA at 72 h increased CCR6 mRNA at 24 h, and decreased CCR8 and CXCR4 mRNA at 24 h of stimulation.

Daytime increases in cortisol via CXCR4 probably act to redistribute naive T cells to bone marrow, whereas daytime increases in catecholamines via beta-adrenoceptors and, possibly, a suppression of fractalkine signaling promote mobilization of effector CD8(+) T cells from the marginal pool.

CCR5 signaling blockade also diminished the in vivo suppressive capacity of T(reg) in inhibiting the antitumor responses of CD8(+) T cells, in the same way as CCL5 signaling blockade.

CCR5 chemokine ligands released from activated CD8(+) T-cells, contribute to the antiviral activity of these cells.

Moreover, transplanted splenic CD8alpha+CD11c-Lin- cells could also home to thymus and lymph nodes and were capable of developing into CD8alpha+ DCs in these locations.

To evaluate whether CD8+ T cell infiltration and distribution within melanoma metastases can predict clinical response to BRAFi, we developed a methodology to integrate immunohistochemistry with automated image analysis of CD8+ T cell position.

Collectively, these data suggest that neonatal CD8+ T cells are inherently biased toward undergoing glycolytic metabolism postinfection, which compromises their ability to develop into memory CD8+ T cells in early life.

In contrast to other Treg cells, CD8(+) CD28(low) Treg cells develop simultaneously with CD8(+) CD28(high) conventional T cells.

This targeting helped CD8(+) T cell immunity develop to a subsequent DNA vaccine and improved protection to intranasal challenge with recombinant vaccinia gag virus, including more rapid accumulation of CD8(+) T cells in the lung.

We hypothesize that late-emerging strains of HIV, such as CXCR4-tropic (X4) virions, induce T-cell homeostasis failure by promoting significantly more bystander cell death, and immune exhaustion in naïve CD4 and all CD8 T-cells, when compared to strain of HIV, such as CCR5-tropic (R5) virions, found early during the course of infection.

De novo, we propose that hyperactive Notch3 signaling by boosting CXCR4-dependent migration promotes anomalous egression of CD4+CD8+ cells from the thymus in early leukemia stages.

Here, we showed that Bcl-6 directs Tfh cell differentiation: Bcl-6-deficient T cells failed to develop into Tfh cells and could not sustain germinal center responses, whereas forced expression of Bcl-6 in CD4(+) T cells promoted expression of the hallmark Tfh cell molecules CXCR5, CXCR4, and PD-1.

Interestingly, persisting clonotypes frequently co-expressed memory/homing-associated genes (CD27, IL7R, EOMES, CD62L/SELL and CCR5) supporting the notion that they are particularly important for long-lasting CD8 T cell responses.

In contrast, TCR-triggered STAT4(-/-) T cells failed to express CCR5 in response to IL-12.

In the 0 ·02 % VC and wild-type groups, dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD) 4 + and CD8+ T cells among splenocytes as well as a significant decrease in IL-2, IL-12p40 and interferon-γ protein production by splenocytes and a significant decrease in T-cell proliferation among splenocytes.

In support of this concept, CCL5 failed to enhance the production of TGF-β by CCR5-deficient T(reg) or to enhance their cytotoxic effects against CD8(+) T cells.

In this study, we analyzed the TCR repertoires of effector memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+ EM cells) and naive CD8+ T cells (CD8+ N cells) in the decidua and peripheral blood of women with normal or complicated pregnancy and examined PD-1 expression at a single-cell level to verify whether antigen-specific CD8+ T cells accumulate in the decidua and to identify immunological differences related to the suppression of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells between normal pregnancy, miscarriage, and preeclampsia.

Some CD8+ T-cell subsets were confirmed to be closely related to HCV infection such as TCM, TEM, TEM RA, Tc17, and CD8+ Treg.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that chicken CD8α1 grouped with known avian CD8α sequences but was somewhat distantly related to the CD8α molecules of other species.

We also demonstrated that the differential sensitivity of naïve CD8+ T cells and CD8+ TILs to β-AR signaling was linked to a strong downregulation of β2-AR expression related to their activation status, since in vitro-activated CD8+ T cells behaved similarly to CD8+ TILs.

While the activation markers S100a8 and S100a9 are strongly increased in CD8+ T cells from both, Hfe-/- mice and HH patients, a differential profile of genes related to differentiation/maturation of CD8+ T memory cells is evident in HH patients only.

We find that Ccr5(-/-) Cxcr3(-/-) cells show markedly decreased contraction after viral clearance leading to the establishment of massive numbers of memory CD8(+) T cells.

Our results indicate that CCR5 boosts T-cell responses to tumors by modulating helper-dependent CD8(+) T-cell activation.

Remarkably, TX527 not only modulated skin-homing receptors as illustrated for the parent compound, but also reduced the expression of lymphoid organ-homing receptors (CD62L, CCR7, and CXCR4) and uniquely promoted surface expression of inflammatory homing receptors (CCR5, CXCR3, and CXCR6) on T cells.

We demonstrate that activated CD40 and LMP-1 co-localize in lipid rafts and recruit TRAF3 there, findings consistent with signals of CD40 and LMP-1 being initiated from lipid rafts.

However, after in vivo systemic injection with bacterial CpG, a larger number of CD4- pDCs are recruited to the LNs and local inoculation by CpG drives CD4- pDCs migrating into local sentinel LNs, suggesting that CD4- pDCs are the main subpopulation migrating to the peripheral LNs.

Mice lacking MHCII in LysM+ or CD11c+ cells maintained systemic antiviral CD4+ T cell responses, but recruited fewer CD4+ T cells into infected lungs.

In vivo, these CD8+ T cells form direct stable contacts with motile naïve CD4+ T cells recruiting them to Ag+DC binding and to the formation of ternary complexes, where CD4+ and CD8+ T cells interact with the DC and with one another.

We hypothesize that HIV+ APC normally fail to stimulate the clones because virally encoded gp 120 sequesters CD4 from the activation complex, but epitope dimers overcome this effect because they are better able to recruit CD4.

However, depletion of CD4(+) T cells resulted in an enhanced immune-mediated interstitial pneumonitis and delayed clearance of SARS-CoV from the lungs, which was associated with reduced neutralizing antibody and cytokine production and reduced pulmonary recruitment of lymphocytes.

STAT3 variants that exhibit autonomous transactivation potential have been detected in 40 % of patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia in clonally expanded CD8(+) T cells.

STAT-5 phosphorylation was detected in purified CD8+CD25+ Tregs from healthy and asthma subjects, indicating that STAT-5 has a role in their pathobiology.

Purified exosomes from CD8(+) T-cell culture supernatant noncytotoxically suppressed CCR5-tropic (R5) and CXCR4-tropic (X4) replication of HIV-1 in vitro through a protein moiety.

The importance of chemokine expression on HIV infection has been emphasized by the discovery that infection of CD4(+) T cells by M-tropic strains of HIV-1 is antagonized by the chemokines RANTES, MIP-1alpha, and MIP-1beta, which are natural ligands of CCR5, a major coreceptor for macrophagetropic (M-tropic) isolates of HIV-1.

Then, in a larger cohort, only baseline CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio was independently associated with immunodiscordance, after adjusting by the viral CXCR4-tropic HIV variants.

Lower CD4(+) T-cell strata were associated with higher CXCR4-tropic virus levels.

Lower CD4 cell counts were associated with CXCR4-using virus in all cohorts.

Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 potently inhibited skin inflammation in both models associated with reduced inflammatory angiogenesis and inflammatory cell accumulation, including dermal CD4+ cells and intraepidermal CD8+ T cells.

CXCR4-usage was identified in 27 strains (4.9 %) and was significantly associated with subtype B (p 0.003) and low CD4 cell count (p 0.01).

The subsequent emergence of HIV variants that use the CXCR4 coreceptor in roughly half of all infections is associated with an accelerated decline of CD4+ T-cells and rate of progression to AIDS.

Primary infection with CXCR4-using viruses was associated with an accelerated rate of disease progression, estimated by a faster decline of CD4 T-cell count under 350 cells/microl and by a reduced delay in initiating a first antiretroviral treatment.

Viruses that use the coreceptor CXCR4 (X4 viruses) are associated with rapid CD4+ cell decline and disease progression.

In contrast, HIV-1 variants that use CXCR4 are typically detected at the later stages, and are associated with a rapid decline in CD4+ T cells and progression to AIDS (refs.

Furthermore, up-regulation of CXCR4 was also associated with the enhancement of HIV replication in human CD4+ T lymphocytes.

Detectable CXCR4-using virus at baseline was associated with a lower baseline CD4(+) T cell count and a higher plasma HIV-1 RNA level.

These findings demonstrated a correlation between the enhanced susceptibility of activated T cells to HIV-1 fusion and accumulation of ubiquitinated 62-64 kDa CXCR4 species, which preferentially associated with CD4.

In CD4+ T cells, drebrin associates with the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and both molecules redistribute to the IS displaying similar dynamics.

As could be expected CXCR4 tropism was associated with lower CD4 T counts.

In conclusion, these findings show that within the context of genotypically-assessed CXCR4 tropism, FPR ≤2% defines (far better than 10 %-FPR) a viral population associated with low CD4 rank, with potentially greater cytopathic effect, and with more advanced disease.

In human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) subtype B infections, the emergence of viruses able to use CXCR4 as a coreceptor is well documented and associated with accelerated CD4 decline and disease progression.

DENV and ZIKV infections and DENV/ZIKV coinfections similarly induced expression of CCR5, CX3CR1, and CXCR3 on CD4 and CD8 T cells.

Here, we report that Zeb1 expression is induced early during T cell development in CD4-CD8- double-negative (DN) stage 2 (DN2).

The TCRαβ and CD8 genes were transduced into γδ T cells induced from peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy volunteers stimulated with Zoledronate and IL-2.

Then, by depleting various T-cell subsets in vivo, we determined that CD8+ T cells are the main mediator of the protective immunity induced by IrPySpz.

However, it is not known why CCR5-mediated HIV-1 infection does not lead to a massive CD4+ T-cell depletion, as occurs in CXCR4-mediated HIV-1 infection.

Additional studies demonstrate that isolated CCR5 activation by R5 Env leads to both de novo expression of FasL and induction of susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis in resting primary CD4 T cells.

Activation of CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 conjugated beads led to induction of a state of anti-viral resistance to infection with strains of viruses that primarily use CCR5 as a coreceptor.

In this study, we also demonstrated that Treg migration to the tumor microenvironment is mediated by CCR5, and these cells are promoting tumor growth via inhibition of antitumor cells such as cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.

On the basis of this evidence, we postulate in this Review that CCR5 antagonists, such as maraviroc, offer neuroprotective benefits in settings in which CCR5 promotes deleterious neuroinflammation, particularly in diseases in which CD8(+) T cells seem to play a pivotal role.

Therefore, this critical and extended role of CCR5 in JE raises possible safety concerns regarding the use of CCR5 antagonists in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals who inhabit regions in which both HIV and flaviviruses, such as JEV and West Nile virus, are endemic.

The recent availability of CCR5 antagonists has raised concern that genetic, biological, or chemical CCR5 knockout, although beneficial against some pathogens (i.

(2) proinflammation and tissue damage pathway triggered by chemokine receptor CCR5 interacting with CD4, CCL3, CCL4, CCL2.

Transcriptional analyses in the off-ART cohort showed decreased expression of interferon-stimulated genes in 5 of 10 chloroquine-treated participants and modest decreases in CD38 and CCR5 RNAs in all chloroquine-treated participants.

Alcohol consumption affects the immune phenotype of CD8 cells since binge drinking pattern was found to be associated with high CD69 and low TLR4, CXCR4 and CCR2 expression, which suggest recent activation, decreased sensitivity to LPS and lower migration capacity in response to chemokines SDF-1 and MCP-1.

CCR5 blockade also suppresses interleukin (IL)-6 induction, which in turn deactivates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) in tumors.

These results indicate that the increased turnover of CD8+ T cells in HIV-infected subjects is mediated by the HIV envelope protein through the CXCR4 chemokine receptor.

We define a multifactorial cytokine profile of CD8(+) T-lymphocytes capable of mediating noncytolytic suppression of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 replication.

Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell apoptosis could be inhibited by CXCR4 blockade, mostly in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome subjects and more weakly in asymptomatic HIV-positive subjects, and depended only partially on the syncytium-inducing/non-syncytium-inducing viral envelope phenotype.

As expected, the soluble CD4 positive control inhibited CXCR4 (50 % inhibitory concentration [ IC₅₀] 3.7 μg/ml) and CCR5 (IC₅₀ 0.03 μg/ml) tropic HIV-1 infectivity.

This migratory response is CD4 independent and inhibited by anti-CXCR4 antibodies and pertussis toxin.

Binding of either the CXC-chemokine, stromal-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1 alpha), or a CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, to CXCR4 inhibits infection of CD4(+) T cells by T-tropic HIV-1, although only SDF-1 alpha triggers T-cell signaling cascades.

Infection of BC7 cells by HIV-1/IIIBx was resistant to anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies but inhibited by the anti-CXCR4 mAb, 12 G5.

Expression of the GBV-C nonstructural phosphoprotein 5 A (NS5A) decreases surface levels of the HIV co-receptor CXCR4, induces the release of SDF-1 and inhibits HIV replication in Jurkat CD4+ T cell lines.

CXCR4- and CCR5- tropic HIV-1 infection was effectively inhibited in hu-BLT mouse spleen-derived human CD4(+) T-cells ex vivo.

Our findings suggest that CB(2) R activation in CD4+ T cells can inhibit actin reorganization and impair productive infection following cell-free or cell-associated viral acquisition of CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 in resting cells.

GB virus C (GBV-C) is an apparently nonpathogenic flavivirus that replicates in CD4 T cells and inhibits HIV replication in vitro by mechanisms including downregulation of HIV entry coreceptors (CCR5 and CXCR4) and induction of chemokines (RANTES, MIP-1alpha, MIP-1 beta, and SDF-1).

These findings support the hypothesis that KOR-related activation of CD4(+) lymphocytes inhibits HIV-1 entry via down-regulation of CXCR4.

All peptides bound to CXCR4 and inhibited HIV entry in a functional assay on CD4(+) HeLa cells.

The natural ligand of CXCR4, SDF-1alpha, was not able to inhibit HHV-7 infection in SupT1 cells or in CD8(+) T-cell-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

CXCR4/T tropic HIV virus (X4) triggers CD4 T cell death through a caspase independent mechanism, whereas CCR5/M tropic HIV virus (R5) HIV triggers a caspase dependent death.

Notably, binding of X4 Env expressed on cells to CXCR4 triggers apoptosis of uninfected CD4+ T cells.

Although astrocytes are evidently resistant to infection of cell-free HIV in vitro, these cells are efficiently infected via cell-tocell contact by which immature HIV virions bud off lymphocytes and have the ability to directly bind to CXCR4 triggering the process of fusion in the absence of CD4.

During HIV-1 entry, binding of the gp120 Env to the initial receptor, CD4 triggers conformational changes in Env that result in the formation and exposure of the highly conserved gp120 site for interaction with the coreceptors, CCR5 and CXCR4.

Our recent results demonstrating increased chemotactic migration in response to CXCL12 in CD4(+) T cells obtained from the elderly, as compared to those from young donors led us to hypothesize that increase in surface expression, because of altered endocytic regulation of CXCR4 on T cells during aging, might be directly responsible for increased migration toward CXCL12.

We show that primary blood monocytes secrete the CXCL12 chemokine, and express the CXCR4 and CXCR7 receptors leading to an autocrine/paracrine loop that contribute to shape monocyte differentiation to a distinct type of macrophages, with an enhanced expression of CD4, CD14, and CD163, or dendritic cells, with a reduced functional ability to stimulate antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses.

Here, we show that human CXCR4 gene is efficiently disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing leading to HIV-1 resistance of human primary CD4(+) T cells.

Inhibition of CXCR4 leads to the elimination of cancer cells by enabling the rapid, intratumoral accumulation of preexisting, PDA-specific CD8(+) T cells, and reveals the antitumor efficacy of the T-cell checkpoint antagonist anti-PD-L1.

Antagonism of CXCR4 significantly improved survival from lethal infection through enhanced intraparenchymal migration of WNV-specific CD8(+) T cells within the brain, leading to reduced viral loads and, surprisingly, decreased immunopathology at this site.

We also report that NF-κB occupancy at the CXCR4 promoter is enhanced in BM-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells of AA mice.

Diminished expression of CD69 and CD86 (B-cell activation markers), CD5 (negative regulator of BCR signaling), and enhanced expression of CXCR4 were observed in 2 patients with CLL, consistent with BCR and IL4 suppression and loss of proliferative capacity.

In transgenic mice overexpressing the constitutively active Notch3 intracellular domain, we detect the progressive increase in circulating blood and bone marrow of CD4+CD8+ cells, characterized by high and combined surface expression of Notch3 and CXCR4.

The fusion inhibitor T20 and CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 are synergistic in vitro at blocking infection of PBMC with clinical isolates [ 115 ] and T20 combined with the CD4 inhibitor PRO 542 have synergistic in vitro effects, with more than 10-fold greater inhibition of R5, X4, and R5X4 strains than either agent alone [ 116 ].

The cell surface expression intensity of CXCR4 was affected only on CD8+ TANG cells, with a significant increase in cell surface expression immediately postexercise versus pre-exercise levels.

We show that during WNV infection, CD11b(+) CD45(hi) infiltrating cells (macrophages) are the primary producers of IL-1β within the CNS and, through the use of an in vitro blood-brain barrier model, that IL-1β promotes CXCR4-mediated T cell adhesion to brain microvasculature endothelial cells.

Binding of gp120 to the receptor, CD4, changes the Env conformation to promote gp120 interaction with the second receptor, CCR5 or CXCR4.

Treatment with anti-CD25 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) significantly reduced the number of these highly suppressive CD4+FoxP3+ cells within the growing tumor and provoked a CD4 and CD8 T cell dependent destruction of the glioma cells.

Total lung leukocyte numbers and relative frequency of CD8 T cells, B cells, macrophages and dendritic cells were greatly reduced in the aged host during SARS-CoV infection, despite high levels of chemoattractants for many of these cells in the aged lung.

The M, spike, and N proteins each accounted for 11 %-27 % of the total CD4+ response, with additional responses commonly targeting nsp3, nsp4, ORF3a, and ORF8, among others.

The inhibition of IL-2/IL-2R gives rise to CD8+ T cell and lymphocyte decrease through JAK1-STAT5 in critical patients with COVID-19 pneumonia.

Thus, during acute infection, the administration of the JAK3 inhibitor besides depleting all NK cell subsets also decreased some CD8⁺ T cells and inhibited the mobilization of the plasmacytoid dendritic cells in the blood and their localization to the GIT.

Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting natural killer (NK) cells and activated NK cells are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry receptor ACE2.

Baseline levels of CD8+ T cells, resting NK cells, and activated NK cells, as well as cytokines that recruit these cells, are significantly lower in lung tissues with high expression of the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Genetic variability across the three major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I genes (human leukocyte antigen A [ HLA-A],-B, and-C genes) may affect susceptibility to and severity of the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Virus-specific CD8 T cells are required for pathogen clearance following primary SARS-CoV infection.

The molecular properties of CD8 + T cells that respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not fully known.

Overall, our single-cell analysis revealed substantial diversity in the nature of CD8 + T cells responding to SARS-CoV-2.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently identified coronavirus family member that triggers a respiratory disease similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV).

Several studies show that the immunosuppressive drugs targeting the interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor, including tocilizumab, ameliorate lethal inflammatory responses in COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Protection was dependent on interferon-γ and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8(+) T\240\cell responses.

Interferon gamma produced by activated ILC1 is critical to licence CD11b+Ly6C+ monocyte production of CXCL9, a chemokine required to recruit skin primed CXCR3+ CD8+T-cells to the FRT.

4-specific CD8+ T cells mediate protection against tuberculosis, which requires interferon-γ production and TAP1-dependent antigen presentation in vivo.

However, the role of SARS-CoV-specific memory CD8 T cells in mediating protection after SARS-CoV challenge has not been previously investigated.

We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and entry mediated by the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein are restricted by IFITM proteins.

Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has evolved a high level of activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of SARS-CoV that emerged previously.

Using gene knockdown technology, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIβ (PI4KB) is required for cellular entry by pseudoviruses bearing the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein and that the cell entry mediated by SARS-CoV spike protein is strongly inhibited by knockdown of PI4KB.

The pathological injury of lung and lymph system induced by SARS-CoV may be mediated respectively by different receptors of SARS-CoV.

SARS-CoV seemed to elicit effective humoral immunity but inhibited cellular immunity, especially CD8+ memory T lymphocytes over time.

SARS-CoV protein-derived peptide-1 (SSp-1 RLNEVAKNL)  induced peptide-specific CTLs both in vivo (transgenic mice) and in vitro (human PBLs), which specifically released interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) upon stimulation with SSp-1-pulsed autologous dendritic cells (DCs) or T2 cells.

The function of FOXO1 in sustaining the DZ program involved the trans-activation of the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and cooperation with the BCL6 transcription factor in the trans-repression of genes involved in immune activation, DNA repair, and plasma cell differentiation.

Loss of ACE2 also leads to increased neutrophilic infiltration in the infarct and peri-infarct regions, resulting in upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, as well as increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling pathways.

Overexpression of PIAS1 significantly activated the SM alpha-actin promoter and mRNA expression, as well as SM myosin heavy chain and SM22alpha, whereas a small interfering RNA for PIAS1 decreased activity of these promoters, as well as endogenous mRNA expression, and SRF binding to SM alpha-actin promoter within intact chromatin in cultured SMC.

PIAS1 and GATA4 synergistically activated IFABP and SI promoters but not LPH promoters suggesting that PIAS1 differentially activates GATA4 targeted promoters.

Nmi does not interact with Max and has no transactivation capabilities in yeast, suggesting that Nmi alone is not a transcriptional activator in mammalian cells.

A deletion analysis revealed that Nmi must interact with IFP 35 to prevent its degradation and that the amino terminus of Nmi is required, but not sufficient, for this function.

Furthermore, overexpression or depletion of NMI revealed its regulation on G1/S progression and cell proliferation (both in vitro and in vivo), and this effect was partially dependent on STAT1, which interacted with and was regulated by NMI.

Therefore only a very small amount of MycN and Nmi is likely to be involved in MycN/Nmi interaction in vivo.

Mouse GBPs promote the lytic destruction of targeted bacteria in the host cell cytosol, but the antimicrobial function of human GBPs and the mechanism by which these proteins associate with cytosolic bacteria are poorly understood.

Because GBPs are critical to target vacuolar bacteria, we determined whether GBP2 and GBPchr3 affect Brucella control in vivo.

Two opposing models are currently proposed to explain the GBPs-inflammasome link: i) GBPs would target intracellular bacteria or bacteria-containing vacuoles to increase cytosolic PAMPs release ii) GBPs would directly facilitate inflammasome complex assembly.

In this retrospective study of a small, select group of patients, (1) the GBP CDR increased significantly with age when potential confounding factors such as GBP dosage, number of GBP doses per day, and concomitant AEDs were considered by analysis of covariance, and (2) patients older than 65 years, even without any known renal disease, may have double GBP CDR than younger adults and, therefore, may need half of the GBP dose per body weight to achieve a similar concentration.

Perhaps the patients in whom GBP increased seizure frequency had complex partial seizures with staring and were therefore unlikely to benefit from drugs such as GBP, CBZ, and PHT, which enhance inhibitory mechanisms in the brain.

In parasites expressing TgROP18I or TgROP18II, NMI only co-immunoprecipitates with TgROP18I and this is associated with allele-specific immunolocalization of NMI on the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (PVM).

Thus, we have shown that Nmi and IFP 35 associate into a protein complex, that IFP 35 is degraded in a proteasome-mediated process, and that a novel function of Nmi is to prevent IFP 35 degradation.

For the survivors (n\240\= 226) we could identify independent predictors of the NMI at discharge from the ERC in the final sex and age-adjusted statistical model: alertness and decannulation were positively associated with the NMI whereas hypoxia, cerebral infarction and traumatic brain injury had a\240\negative impact on cognitive ability.

Finally, in line with a previous report, we found that streptonigrin inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation raising the possibility that non-canonical STAT function may contribute to the effects of streptonigrin on heterochromatin.

Furthermore, we revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of β-sitosterol resulted from its inhibitory effect on retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, led to decreased STAT1 signaling, thus affecting the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3) complexes and resulting in abrogation of the IAV-induced proinflammatory amplification effect in IFN-sensitized cells.

We demonstrate that NMI co-purifies with RNA polymerase II and that NMI is necessary for basal transcription by RNA polymerase II because antibodies to NMI inhibit transcription while adding NMI stimulates transcription.

NMI did not actively inhibit DC maturation as NMI-infected DC subsequently matured if treated with Escherichia coli LPS or Nine Mile phase II.

Our study showed that NMI suppressed tumor growth by inhibiting PI3K/AKT, MMP2/MMP9, COX-2/PGE2 signaling pathways and p300-mediated NF-κB acetylation, and predicted a favorable prognosis in human lung adenocarcinomas, suggesting that NMI was a potential tumor suppressor in lung cancer.

However, no proteins encoded by herpesviruses have been reported to interact with Nmi and inhibit Nmi-mediated activation of IFN-γ immune responses to achieve immune evasion from IFN-γ responses.

Thus, UL23 appears to interact directly with Nmi and inhibit nuclear translocation of Nmi and its associated protein STAT1, leading to a decrease of IFN-γ induced responses and an increase of viral resistance to IFN-γ.

Overexpression of NMI inhibits NF-κB transcriptional activity, in contrast, depletion of NMI by shRNA increases NF-κB transcriptional activity.

As Nmi may play important roles in interferon (IFN)-induced responses, we investigated the mechanism how Nmi protein is regulated.

The results showed that NMII induced dose-dependent cell death in murine peritoneal B1a cells but NMI did not, suggesting that NMI and NMII may differentially activate host cell apoptotic signaling in B1a cells.

We also found that heat-killed NMII and type 4 secretion system (T4SS) mutant NMII were unable to induce B1a cell death and that NMII infection did not induce cell death in peritoneal B1a cells from Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2)-or NLRP3 inflammasome-deficient mice.

Because PMI and TDI are chromophores with high fluorescence quantum yields and high resistance to photobleaching compared to NMI, 360-nm excitation of a single triad molecule leads to bleaching of NMI chromophores with no chance for PMI to be observed.

Microinjection of antibodies against actin or NMI, as well as short interfering RNA-mediated depletion of NMI decreased Pol I transcription in vivo, whereas overexpression of NMI augmented pre-rRNA synthesis.

In contrast, serum NMI was significantly decreased in HBV-ACLF ameliorated patients during follow-up, whereas serum NMI was sustained at high levels in non-ameliorated patients.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Imolecules regulate adaptive immune responses through the presentation of antigenic peptides to CD8+ T cells.

One of these studies revealed that defect in antigen presentation is largely due to down-regulation of the cysteine protease Cathepsin S (CatS), which prevents MHC II molecule maturation and proper antigen peptide loading.

Additionally, these MHC-II/peptide complexes that interact with T-cell receptors (TCR) of pathogenic CD4+ T cells are compatible with a different number of assays like Intracelullar Cytokine Staining (ICS), and Carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) making it a robust technology to study the functionality of allergen-specific CD4+ T cells.

Unlike CFZ-CD, the locally injected CFZ-pTA-alb protected or enhanced CD8+ T cell population in tumors, helped develop splenocytes with tumor-specific interferon-γ response, and delayed tumor development on the contralateral side in immunocompetent mice (but not in athymic nude mice), supporting that CFZ-pTA-alb contributed to activating antitumor immunity.

Phenotypic and functional analysis of c-Met+CD8+ T cells revealed that they recognize the encephalitogenic epitope myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein37-50.

Both the stemlike CD8 T cells and their terminally differentiated progeny showed minimal migration during chronic infection and the few LCMV-specific CD8 T cells that were present in circulation were the recently emerging progeny from the stemlike CD8 T cells.

Some of these epitope-specific CD8 T cells emerge in the weeks and months following infection and rapidly select for sequence variants, whereas other CD8 T cell responses develop during the chronic infection phase and rarely select for sequence variants.

The main cytokine associated with these protective responses is interferon-γ (IFN-γ), whose production is known to be regulated at the transcriptional level during CD8+ T cell differentiation.

Mechanistically, DMC and TMZ synergistically increase intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, activate caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway, and inactivate of JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in GBMs, which account for the cell apoptosis and proliferation inhibition.

Hence, reinstating Jak/Stat3 signaling in the presence of increased Zac1 expression allows for timely astroglial differentiation.

Evidence was found that STAT3 is more resistant than STAT1 to intermolecular disulfide bond formation under oxidizing conditions and more likely to retain the monomeric form, suggesting that conformational differences explain the differential effect of GSH depletion on STAT1 and STAT3.

Consequently, therapies that result in JAK2 degradation retain efficacy in persistent cells and may provide additional benefit to patients with JAK2-dependent malignancies treated with JAK2 inhibitors.

Treatment with JAK inhibitors, when added with IFN-α prevented MHC class I overexpression, but when added 24 \240\h after IFN-α exposure these inhibitors failed to accelerate MHC class I return to baseline.

IFN-α mediates a long-lasting and preferential MHC class I overexpression in human beta cells, which is not affected by the subsequent addition of JAK inhibitors.

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E and the host interactome were inferred through published protein-protein interactions (PPI) as well as gene co-expression triggered by HCoV S-glycoprotein in host cells.

Similar cellular programs were activated in ACE2-positive PTEC isolated in a urine sample from a COVID19 patient with acute kidney injury, suggesting a consistent ACE2-coregulated expression program that may interact with SARS-Cov-2 infection processes.

Several differences were observed between the residues of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV that consistently interacted with ACE2.

Given the common use of RAAS inhibitors among solid organ transplant recipients, we sought to review the RAAS cascade, the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 entry, and pertinent data related to the effect of RAAS inhibitors on ACE2 to guide management of solid organ transplant recipients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Here we first investigated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses to utilize animal orthologs of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry.

A previous study indicated that ACE2 from a horseshoe bat, the host of a highly related SARS-like coronavirus, could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV.

SARS-CoV-2 itself is not a recombinant of any sarbecoviruses detected to date, and its receptor-binding motif, important for specificity to human ACE2 receptors, appears to be an ancestral trait shared with bat viruses and not one acquired recently via recombination.

ACE2 acts as receptor for the novel SARS coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) which raising the important issue of possible detrimental effects that RAS blockers could exert on the natural history and pathogenesis of the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) and associated excessive inflammation, myocarditis and cardiac arrhythmias.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) acts as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19.

The interaction between the key amino acids of S protein RBD and ACE2 indicated that, other than pangolins and snakes, as previously suggested, turtles (Chrysemys picta bellii, Chelonia mydas, and Pelodiscus sinensis) may act as the potential intermediate hosts transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans.

We investigated phenotypic and genetic factors associated with subcutaneous adipose tissue expression of Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been shown to act as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry.

However, previous studies indicated the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein, a known SARS-CoV receptor, from a horseshoe bat was unable to act as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV.

Furthermore, our current study also demonstrates that the genetic diversity of ACE2 among bats is greater than that observed among known SARS-CoV susceptible mammals, highlighting the possibility that there are many more uncharacterized bat species that can act as a reservoir of SARS-CoV or its progenitor viruses.

Although the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus affecting the cerebrovascular system has not been elucidated yet, researchers have identified several pathogenic mechanisms, including a role for the ACE2 receptor.

Due to the presence of ACE2-Neprilysin-CA complex in most of vital organs and as a receptor of COVID-19, it is expected that most organs are affected by SARS-CoV-2 such as inflammation and fibrosis of lungs, which may conversely affect their vital functions, temporary or permanently, sometimes leading to death.

However, SARS-CoV-2 can affect several human organs due to high expressions of ACE2 receptor which is the main viral target and the virus may affect not only higher and lower respiratory tracts, but also heart, kidney, gastro enteric tract, liver, pancreas, nervous system and skin.

It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 affects how ACE2 and ACE work.

However, not every organ in which ACE2 is abundant is affected by SARS-CoV-2, which suggests the existence of other multi-organ routes for transmitting the perturbations produced by the virus.

Limited studies have suggested: (i) no direct interactions between ibuprofen and SARS-CoV-2 and (ii) there is no evidence to suggest ibuprofen affects the regulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for COVID-19, in human studies.

This means that preventing uptake of ACE2 into the cell by blocking AT1R would be a more logical approach to limit entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the cell.

We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.

Among the studied compounds, we found that dithymoquinone (DTQ), with binding affinity of-8.6 kcal/mol compared to a positive control (chloroquine,-7.2 kcal/mol), has the high potential of binding at SARS-CoV-2:ACE2 interface and thus could be predicted as a plausible inhibitor to disrupt viral-host interactions.

Recently, a critical debatable question has arisen whether using antihypertensive medications will have a favorable impact on people infected with SARS-CoV-2 or a deleterious one, mainly because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) and angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) therapy can modulate the expression of ACE2 protein.

Accumulating evidence now suggests that genetic polymorphisms in the ACE2 gene may modulate intermolecular interactions with the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and/or contribute to pulmonary and systemic injury by fostering vasoconstriction, inflammation, oxidation and fibrosis.

To investigate bats and pangolin as hosts in SARS-CoV-2 cross-species transmission, we perform an evolutionary analysis combining viral and host phylogenies and divergence of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 amino acid sequences between CoV hosts.

This work focuses on the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 entry through a hypothesized α5β1integrin-based mechanism, and indicates that inhibiting α5β1 integrin interaction with ACE2 and the spike protein using a novel molecule ATN-161 represents a promising approach to treat COVID-19.

Unfortunately, ACE2 also serves as the binding receptor of SARS viral spike glycoprotein, enabling its attachment to host cells, with subsequent viral internalization and replication.

This suggests a novel model of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in which infected cells shift toward an increasingly mesenchymal state and lose ACE2 expression, along with its acute respiratory distress syndrome-protective effect, in a ZEB1-dependent manner.

2019 Novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) destroys angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and breaks the balance of renin-angiotension system (RAS) by interacting with ACE2.

We see that some ACE2 glycans interact with the S fragments, and glycans are influencing the conformation of the ACE2 receptor.

Of importance are Heparan Sulfate Proteoglycans (HSPGs) and the host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as based on other activities lactoferrin might prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from attaching to the host cells.

The virus-mediated down-regulation of ACE2 causes a burst of inflammatory cytokine release through dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ACE/angiotensin II/AT1R axis), attenuation of Mas receptor (ACE2/MasR axis), increased activation of [ des-Arg9]-bradykinin (ACE2/bradykinin B1R/DABK axis), and activation of the complement system including C5a and C5b-9 components.

We found that after ectodomain shedding, ACE2 is targeted for intramembrane proteolysis by γS releasing a soluble ACE2 C-terminal fragment.

As for SARS-CoV that caused the SARS 2003 epidemic, the receptor on host cells that promotes uptake, through attachment of the spike (S) protein of the virus, is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).

Neither binding to ACE2 nor cleavage by trypsin at the S1/S2 cleavage site impart large conformational changes within stabilized SARS-CoV S or expose the secondary cleavage site, S2\.

Moreover, experimental evidence suggests that RAAS blockade by ACE inhibitors, ANG II type 1 receptor antagonists, and mineralocorticoid antagonists, as well as statins enhance ACE2 which, in part, contributes to the benefit of these regimens.

In lieu of the fact that many older patients with hypertension or other CVDs are routinely treated with RAAS blockers and statins, new clinical concerns have developed regarding whether these patients are at greater risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, whether RAAS and statin therapy should be discontinued, and the potential consequences of RAAS blockade to COVID-19-related pathologies such as acute and chronic respiratory disease.

moreover, several residue changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD-ACE2 interface.

In contrast to IFNs, IL-4 did not show antiviral activity when administered immediately after SARS-CoV infection, suggesting that IL-4 acts early during the SARS-CoV replication cycle.

Further, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, and off-label antiviral drugs, such as the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, HIV protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs arbidol and favipiravir as well as antiviral phytochemicals available to date may limit spread of SARS-CoV-2 and morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 pandemic.

Notably, whether the ACE-related inhibitors or drugs modulated ACE2 activity in affecting the viral activity and disease severity of SARS-CoV-2 is still an open question.

Our results reconcile current knowledge on ACE2 expression and suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to affect the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.

Structural and sequence variants in ACE2 gene may affect its expression in different tissues and determine a differential response to SARS-Cov-2 infection and the COVID-19-related phenotype.

However, it remains unclear how genetic variations in ACE2 may affect its function and structure, and consequently alter the recognition by SARS-CoV-2.

These findings provide novel insight into the genetic variation in ACE2 which may affect the SARS-CoV-2 recognition and infection, and COVID-19 susceptibility and treatment.

The prolonged exposure to combinations of these medications could regulate the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a way that may affect kidney susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

A KATZ-based VDA prediction method (VDA-KATZ) is developed to infer possible drugs associated with SARS-CoV-2.

Overall, these findings emphasize the versatility of IGHV3-53 in this common antibody response to SARS-CoV-2, where conserved IGHV3-53 germline-encoded features can be combined with very different CDR H3 lengths and light chains for SARS-CoV-2 RBD recognition and virus neutralization.

, 3 CLpro (main protease), PLpro (papain-like protease), SGp-RBD (spike glycoprotein-receptor binding domain), RdRp (RNA dependent RNA polymerase) and ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2).

The interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein, promoting host receptor recognition and binding to ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), thus representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

The interaction is mediated by the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S glycoprotein promoting host receptor recognition and binding to ACE2 peptidase domain (PD), thus representing a promising target for therapeutic intervention.

No evidence suggests stopping angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-renin-blockers or statins, even it has been suggested that they may increase the expression of Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor, which is used by " Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to penetrate into the cells.

COVID-19 is a major public health issue around the world and new data about its etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2, are urgently necessary, also translating the scientific knowledge acquired on its more similar predecessors, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV, the coronaviruses responsible for SARS and MERS, respectively.

Apelin modulation of the RAS by increasing ACE2 action is limited due to its rapid degradation by proteases, including ACE2, neprilysin (NEP), and kallikrein.

However, few other natural products like resveratrol, quercetin, luteolin, naringenin, zingiberene, and gallic acid has the significant binding affinity towards ACE2 receptor only and therefore may be used for ACE2-mediated attachment inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.

Remdesivir is an antiviral medication targeting ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis that has clinical improvement in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.

There are many possible mechanisms through which GZ acts against viruses: increasing nitrous oxide production in macrophages affecting transcription factors and cellular signalling pathways, directly altering the viral lipid-bilayer membrane, and binding to the ACE2 receptor.

Here, we report the isolation and characterization of an alpaca-derived single domain antibody fragment, Ty1, that specifically targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike, directly preventing ACE2 engagement.

We review here the evidence regarding the role of estrogenic hormones in ACE2 expression and regulation, with the intent of bringing to the forefront potential mechanisms that may explain sex differences in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 outcomes, assist in management of COVID-19, and uncover new therapeutic strategies.

Interestingly, some products may block the ACE-2 receptor or the serine protease TMPRRS2 required by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells.

Because RBD-ACE2 binding is compatible with the semi-open state, but not with the closed state of the S protein, we propose that the formation of the intermediate state is a prerequisite for the host cell recognition.

The spike (S) glycoprotein binds ACE2 and promotes SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.

ACE2, and TMPRSS2 protease promote SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, while inflammatory cytokines IL-6, or G-CSF worsen COVID-19 severity.

In this paper, we also review the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how it worsens CVD and postulate that the differences in modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) axis which controls angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)/ACE2 balance may be an important determinant of COVID-19 outcomes in Africa.

It was concluded that salicylic acid as an allelochemical greatly inhibited FON growth and conidia formation and germination, though stimulated mycotoxin production and activities of hydrolytic enzymes by FON.

It was concluded that cinnamic acid dramatically stimulated mycotoxin production and activities of hydrolytic enzymes by FON but inhibited growth and germination of FON.

In this study, two new primer sets, Fon-1/Fon-2 and FnSc-1/FnSc-2, were developed to differentiate Fon and Fo, respectively.

In addition, with optimized PCR parameters, the molecular method using the Fon-1/Fon-2 primer set could directly detect Fon even when watermelon samples were collected in its early stage of disease development.

After the cultivation of watermelon for 50 d, a higher density of XG-1 (9.79 × 105 colony-forming units (CFU)/g) and one order of magnitude lower of Fon (1.29 × 103 copies/g) were detected in the rhizosphere soil compared with soils without bio-organic fertilizer (7.59 × 104 copies/g for Fon), leading to an 86.4 % control efficiency of watermelon caused by Fusarium wilt.

The lowest BRCF encountered among all units for a given isointensity ON-response bandwidth (delta FON) increased as a function of delta FON.

fluorene (FEN), fluorenone (FON) and 4-benzoyl-FON, but also the genotoxic 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) and 2, 4, 7-trinitro-FON induced a selective mitotic response of the zona fasciculata (ZF).

FonNot2 was expressed at higher levels in conidia and germinating conidia and during infection in Fon-inoculated watermelon roots than in mycelia.

Disrupting the FonSIX6 gene in Fon race 1 did not affect the sporulation or growth rate of the fungus but significantly enhanced Fon virulence in watermelon, suggesting that the mutant ΔFon1SIX6 protein allowed evasion of R protein-mediated host resistance.

Interactions between PSK and FON were analysed and it was found that transcript of Clpsk1 was significantly induced upon FON infection.

To determine genetic diversity of the pathogen, FON isolates were collected from symptomatic watermelon plants in commercial fields in Georgia and Florida, USA, and identified based on morphological characteristics and PCR analysis using FON-specific primers.

Lastly, we describe the identification and characterization of two novel E1B-55K interacting factors, importin-alpha 1 and pp32, that may also participate in the functions previously ascribed to E1B-55K and E4-orf6.

Out of the various recombinants carrying the relevant ketoreductases, the set of gra-ORF5 and-ORF6 under translational coupling (on pIK191) led to the most efficient production of (R)-DNPA as a single product, implying a possible unique cooperative function whereby gra-ORF6 might encode a " guiding" protein to control the regio- and stereochemical course of reduction at C-3 catalyzed by the gra-ORF5 protein.

Consistent with the observed increase in the biochemical interaction between 55 K and Orf3 in the absence of Orf6, the 55 K association with Orf3 in ND10 was also found to increase in the absence of Orf6.

Citrinin production was significantly greater (3.6-fold) in the Δorf6 strain than in the wild-type Monascus purpureus YY-1, and RT-PCR analysis further revealed increased expression of numerous genes of the citrinin biosynthesis gene cluster in Δorf6.

Sequence similarity between ActVA-Orf6 protein from the actinorhodin biosynthetic cluster and the previously characterized TcmH protein that is involved in tetracenomycin biosynthesis suggested that ActVA-Orf6 might catalyze this transformation as a step in actinorhodin biosynthesis.

In particular, the distal ORF6+ORF7 segment from the E4 locus of adenovirus type 5 was cloned under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat.

First, we investigated whether proteins were produced from ORF5 and ORF6 by in vitro translation of appropriate viral transcripts, searched for antibodies against the putative proteins in the sera of animals infected with wild-type virus, and looked for an antisense WHV transcript, necessary for expression of a protein from ORF6, in the livers of acutely or chronically infected woodchucks.

1 of ORF6 and ORF7, respectively induced the highest IFN-gamma responses, suggesting that these peptides represented the immunodominant Th1 cell epitopes of RD1 ORF6 and ORF7 in the patients tested.

Base on phylogenetic analysis for ORF5 and ORF6, 3 isolates closely related to QYYZ strain form a new subgroup IV, while 3 other ones were clustered into subgroup III, represented by NADC30.

While ORF4 (45-kDa), ORF5 (44-kDa), and ORF6 (16-kDa) have no apparent sequence homology with other known viruses, ORF5 is predicted to encode a movement protein (MP) that is phylogenetically related to the furovirus MP and ORF6 was experimentally proven to encode a viral suppressor of RNA silencing.

However, for most ORFs, ocular strains presented lower expression than genital or lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) strains, and ORF6/pgp4 (transcriptional regulator of virulence associated genes) presented the highest mean expression among strains, followed by the virulence factor ORF5/pgp3 (also regulated by ORF6/pgp4).

The ORF6 protein of tomato mosaic virus (ToMV) strain L (L-ORF6)  interacts in vitro with eukaryotic elongation factor 1 α, and mutation of the ORF6 gene of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) strain U1 (U1-ORF6) reduces the pathogenicity in vivo of TMV, whereas expression of this gene from two other viruses, tobacco rattle virus (TRV) and potato virus X (PVX), increases their pathogenicity.

Neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir are invalid for 2019-nCoV and are not recommended for treatment but protease inhibitors such as lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) inhibit the progression of MERS-CoV disease and can be useful for patients of COVID-19 and, in combination with Arbidol, has a direct antiviral effect on early replication of SARS-CoV.

The infection of SARS-CoV is mediated mainly through the viral surface glycoproteins, which consist of S1 and S2 subunits and form trimer spikes on the envelope of the virions.

Here we describe our observations of SARS-CoV using ADE to enhance the infectivity of a HL-CZ human promonocyte cell line.

To understand the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV, human type II pneumocyte (A549) cells were incubated with the viral spike protein or with SARS-CoV virus-like particles containing the viral spike protein to examine cytokine modulation in lung cells.

SARS-COV can not infect the femoral head tissue and lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head directly by the spike glycoprotein, and mechanism of the virus for causing avascular necrosis needs further investigation.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein (S) is a class I viral fusion protein that binds to its receptor glycoprotein, human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), and mediates virus entry and cell-cell fusion.

The SARS-CoV spike provides an ideal model system to study receptor binding and membrane fusion in the native state, employing cryo-electron microscopy and single-particle image analysis.

Interferons (IFNs) inhibit severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) replication and might be valuable for SARS treatment.

Here, we present cryo-EM analyses of a stabilized trimeric SARS-CoV S, as well as the trypsin-cleaved stabilized S, and its interactions with ACE2.

The present study aimed at investigating whether ACE2 is involved in physiological stretch (10 % elongation, 1 Hz) mediated cellular functions and the underlying mechanism.

In a previous study, exposure to hypoxia increased the expressions of ACE2 and Mas, and stimulated ACE2 shedding.

We included 15 additional agents (sivelestat, mesenchymal stem cells, ulinastatin, anisodimine, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, recombinant human ACE2 (palifermin), AP301, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), levosimendan, prostacyclins, lisofylline, ketaconazole, nitroglycerins, L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylic acid (OTZ), and penehyclidine hydrochloride).

Our results indicated that Ang II enhances AT1 receptor, downregulates AT2 receptor, ACE2 activity and eNOS expression, and increases CD44 expression and hyaluronidase activity, an enzyme for hyaluronan degradation.

Selective activating ACE2/eNOS and inhibiting CD44/HA interaction might be considered as the therapeutic targets for attenuating Ang II induced deleterious cardiovascular effects.

Binding of gp120 to the primary receptor, CD4 triggers the transition to an open conformation of the trimer, promoting interaction with the CCR5 chemokine receptor and ultimately leading to gp41-mediated virus-cell membrane fusion and entry.

NKR cells expressing the CCR5 co-receptor are used as a target cells following: (i) coating with recombinant envelope glycoprotein, (ii) infection with infectious molecular clones expressing the Env antigens of primary and lab adapted viruses, or (iii) chronic infection with a variant of HIV-1/IIIB, termed A1953.

CCR5mim-Ig also stabilized the association of a CD4-mimetic peptide with the envelope glycoprotein.

Env binds cellular CD4, an association which stabilizes a conformation favorable to its subsequent association with a coreceptor, typically CCR5 or CXCR4.

Therefore, enhanced utilization of CD4 is one mechanism by which HIV-1 can overcome mutations in the V3 region that negatively affect CCR5 interactions.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CD4 expression level in primary T cells affects their susceptibility to CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infection but not VSV G-pseudotyped HIV-1 infection.

Following the CD4 binding, CCR5-tropic viruses recruited a requisite number of coreceptors much faster than CXCR4-tropic viruses.

Biochemical analysis reveals that CXCR4 and LFA-1 are recruited to lipid rafts upon CD4 but not CD45 engagement.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, possesses conserved binding sites for interaction with the primary virus receptor, CD4, and also for the co-receptor, generally CCR5.

HIV-1 Env glycoprotein-mediated fusion is initiated upon sequential binding of Env to CD4 and the coreceptor CXCR4 or CCR5.

This retroviral vector will prove useful for the study of HIV infection events mediated by the HIV-2 envelope glycoproteins, as well as for the targeting of CD4+ cells in the context of gene therapy of AIDS.

Here, we characterized tropism alterations for CD4+ T-cell subsets and macrophages by Envs from two subjects who developed MVC resistance in vivo, which displayed either relatively efficient or inefficient recognition of MVC-bound CCR5.

In contrast, MVC-resistant Env with inefficient recognition of drug-bound CCR5 displays no change in tropism for CD4+ T-cell subsets, but exhibits a significant reduction in macrophage infectivity.

We found that bNabs directed against the CD4 binding site (n = 10), peptidoglycans at the base of variable loop 3 (V3) (n = 5), and epitopes at the interface of surface (gp120) and membrane-bound (gp41) envelope glycoproteins (n = 5) failed to neutralize SIVcpz and SIVgor strains.

Following purification, most glycoproteins, except for 10 G, were recognized by broadly neutralizing CD4bs-directed antibodies.

To this end, we devised a bicistronic lentiviral vector expressing the membrane-bound form of the T20 fusion inhibitor, referred to as the C46 peptide, and a CCR5 superagonist, modified to sequester CCR5 away from the cell surface, referred to as the P2-CCL5 intrakine.

STAT3 silencing also increased the levels of CCL4, a CCR5-binding chemokine known to be involved in T helper 1 (Th1) cell recruitment.

Here we report that CD4-independent SIV variants that emerged in vivo in a CD4+ T cell-depleted rhesus macaque model display markedly decreased plasticity of co-receptor use.

Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) strains that infect cells in the absence of cellular CD4 emerge spontaneously in vitro after culture in CD4+ T-cell lines.

CD4 counts fall more rapidly in advanced disease when CCR5-tropic viral strains tend to be replaced by X4-tropic viruses.

In peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the majority of memory CD4+ T cells appear to fall into either of these two lineages, CCR5-CXCR5+ or CCR5+CXCR5-.

BMS-378806 (here called BMS-806) blocks CD4-induced conformational changes in Env important for entry and is hypothesized to stabilize a state-1-like Env conformation, a key vaccine target.

The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) envelope (Env) glycoprotein, a (gp120-gp41) 3 trimer mediates fusion of viral and host cell membranes after gp120 binding to host receptor CD4.

Compared to LCs, epidermal CD11c+ DCs are enriched in anogenital tissues where they preferentially interact with HIV, express the higher levels of HIV entry receptor CCR5 support the higher levels of HIV uptake and replication and are more efficient at transmitting the virus to CD4 T cells.

Designing a pair of single-guide RNA targeting the flank region of the CCR5Δ32 mutation locus, we applied the CRISPR-Cas9 and lentiviral packaging\240\system to successfully convert wild-type CCR5 into CCR5Δ32/Δ32 homozygotes in the human Jurkat CD4+ cell line and primary CD4+ cells, exactly the same as the naturally occurring CCR5Δ32/Δ32 mutation.

Loss of CXCR6 usage by SIVcpz may have altered its cell tropism, shifting virus from CXCR6-expressing cells that may support replication without disrupting immune function or homeostasis, towards CCR5-expressing cells with pathogenic consequences.

Using giant plasma membrane vesicles containing cholesterol-rich ordered and cholesterol-poor fluid lipid domains, we demonstrate that the HIV receptor CD4 is substantially sequestered into ordered domains, whereas the co-receptor CCR5 localizes preferentially at ordered/disordered domain boundaries.

Experiments performed with specific inhibitors revealed that entry of HIV-1 in activated CD4(+) T cells is regulated by LFA-1-dependent ZAP70, phospholipase Cgamma1, and calpain enzymatic activities.

The external HIV envelope glycoprotein, gp120, sequentially interacts with two cellular receptor molecules, the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor, such as CCR5 or CXCR4, leading to the activation of the fusogenic domain of the transmembrane viral glycoprotein, gp41, which changes its conformation to create a hairpin structure that eventually triggers fusion between the viral and cellular membranes.

Here we show that the zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), a key element in TCR signaling is required for CXCR4 signal transduction.

Here we show that the zeta-associated protein 70 (ZAP-70), a key element in TCR signaling, is required for CXCR4 signal transduction.

In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that U50488 treatment of CD4(+) lymphocytes inhibits HIV-1 envelope (Env) glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion.

To test the hypothesis that inefficient formation of gp120-CD4-CXCR4 complexes could contribute to the mechanism of resistance to Env-mediated fusion in the minus clones, we incubated plus and minus cells with HIV-1 LAI gp120 and coimmunoprecipitated CD4 by using anti-CXCR4 antibodies.

CXCR4 down-regulation may be due to intracellular sequestering of HIV glycoprotein/CXCR4 complexes.

In addition, the cortical actin in CD45RO memory CD4 T cells is more dynamic and can respond to low dosages of chemotactic induction by SDF-1, whereas that of naive cells cannot, despite a similar level of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 present on both cells.

SARS-CoV-2 patient plasma inhibited HLA-DR expression, and this was partially restored by the IL-6 blocker Tocilizumab.

AML1/EVI-1 associates with JNK through the first zinc-finger domain of EVI-1 and disturbs the association between JNK and its substrates.

Deletion of 72 AML1 C-terminal residues, which includes a transrepression domain, did not alter the activity of AML1-ER, whereas further deletion of 98 residues removing the most potent AML1 transactivation domain (TAD), prevented rescue of cell cycle inhibition.

Presented data support the hypothesis that HDACi affect ETV6/RUNX1-positive cells via direct interaction with ETV6/RUNX1 protein and that treatment with HDACi may release aberrant transcription activity caused by ETV6/RUNX1 chimeric transcription factor.

We show that mSin3A also protects AML1 from proteasome-mediated degradation and that phosphorylation-induced release of AML1 from mSin3A results in degradation of AML1 in a time-dependent manner.

Thus, CBFbeta-SMMHC directly inhibits the proliferation of normal myeloid progenitors via inhibition of AML1 and dependent upon the integrity of its assembly competence domain.

Results also show that the CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein transdominantly inhibits definitive hematopoiesis, but not to the same extent as homozygous loss of Runx1 or Cbfb.

These findings support the development of therapeutics that target the ability of CBFbeta-SMMHC to interact with AML1 or to multimerize via its assembly competence domain.

Although the C-terminal VWRPY motif-deficient mutant of Runx1, which cannot interact with the transcriptional corepressor Transducin-like enhancer of split (TLE)  promoted the double-negative to double-positive transition, it did not efficiently repress CD4 expression.

Lastly, AML1/EVI-1 enhances AP-1 activity by activating the c-Fos promoter depending on the second zinc-finger domain of EVI-1, and promotes cell proliferation.

The AML1 gene did not appear to be the common target of this amplification because this locus had been lost by the psu idic(21) in one patient In CBFbeta-SMMHC, core binding factor beta (CBFbeta) is fused to the alpha-helical rod domain of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMMHC).

We have identified a nonapeptide (RIAECILGM), encoded by the fusion region of the ETV6-AML1 protein, that binds to HLA-A2.

In these lines, CBFbeta-SMMHC expression is regulated by the zinc-responsive metallothionein promoter.

The mechanism for it has been mainly attributed to competition with AML1 for the DNA-binding and for the interaction with PEBP2beta (CBFbeta), a partner protein which heterodimerizes with AML1.

Deletion of 283 carboxyl-terminal residues from the SMMHC domain, required for multimerization, also inactivated CBFbeta-SMMHC.

On the basis of these results, we propose that in undifferentiated mESCs, Zap70 plays important roles in modulating the balance between self-renewal capacity and pluripotent differentiation ability as a key regulator of the Jak/Stat3/c-Myc signaling pathway.

We aimed to detect whether TFV and/or its prodrug, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), are substrates of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are functionally expressed in the placenta, namely P-glycoprotein (ABCB1/MDR1), Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (ABCG2/BCRP) and Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2 (ABCC2/MRP2).

Drug transporters such as P-glycoprotein and OATPs regulate intestinal permeability of atazanavir and may contribute to its poor oral bioavailability and drug-drug interactions with other protease inhibitors and TDF.

Two patients underwent intermittent treatment with TDF and LMV responding any time TDF was reintroduced.

Among the 243 who used ZDV and NVP, intrapartum/early postpartum transmission was not reduced among infants whose mothers received TDF/FTC compared with those who did not (2 of 123 [ 1.6 % ] vs.

Coadministration of TDF with LPV/r resulted in increased tenofovir exposures at steady state, possibly through increased absorption.

Lopinavir (LPV) plasma AUC(0τ), C(max) and Cτ decreased by 23 %, 14 % and 40 %, respectively, following administration of lopinavir/ritonavir with GSK2248761.

Oral TDF/FTC has proven effective in the prevention of HIV infection in men having sex with men, and recent press releases divulged that oral TDF/FTC is also effective in preventing HIV infection in serodiscordant couples in Botswana, Kenya and Uganda.

Mutations compromising nonthymidine analogue backbones were rare, suggesting that it is likely that children who fail first-line NRTI backbones containing d4T or ZDV/3TC would still respond to abacavir (ABC), didanosine (ddI), and, for adolescents, tenofovir (TDF).

TDF clearance increased significantly with BW and decreased with lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) coadministration, thus these factors were used to propose doses for children.

tuberculosis infection (defined by positive results on interferon-γ release assay) without evidence of active tuberculosis disease at centers in Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia.

ZFNCCR5Δ32 effectively recognized the CCR5Δ32 region, inducing a frameshift of the CCR5 coding region that resulted in the complete absence of CCR5 expression of mRNA and of protein at the cell surface.

The obtained mutant fingerprint profiles of CCR5 inhibitors were used to translate the CCR5 allosteric binding site into a general pharmacophore, which can be used for discovering new inhibitors.

Studies have reported an association of HLA-B,1502 and HLA-B,5801 in patients with the Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis provoked by carbamazepine, as well as of HLA-B,5701 with abacavir hypersensitivity.

Analysis by size exclusion chromatography revealed two distinct populations of CD81, only one of which bound the HCV glycoprotein, E2.

Here we show that a single-dose immunization of ZIKV purified inactivated vaccine (ZPIV) 4-7 in a dengue virus (DENV)-experienced human elicited potent cross-neutralizing antibodies to both ZIKV and DENV.

However, as additional studies into the function of Type I Interferons progressed, it was also seen that pathogenic viruses have coevolved to encode potent mechanisms allowing them to evade or suppress the impact of Type I Interferons on their replication.

T helper cell responses to the peptides were evaluated by ELISpot (gamma-interferon) assay, using peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) obtained from 34 healthy long term non-progressor (LT) or moderate-progressor (MP) donors (median years infected = 8.88, median CD4 T cells = 595, median VL = 1044).

However, SIVcpz nef genes as a group showed a 1.8-and 2.0-fold-higher activity in modulating CD28 (P = 0.0002) and Ii (P = 0.016) surface expression, respectively, but were 1.7-fold less active in down-regulating MHC class II molecules (P = 0.006) compared to HIV-1 M nef genes.

By comparison, human type I interferons, IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, showed similar effects (enhanced the expression by about 40-60 %) to ISP-BSA on the MHC class I expression on H9 and U937 cells.
